    title: Red Red Wine
    artist: UB40
    year: '1988'
    genres:
      - Reggae fusion
    commentary: This one’s a personal favorite of mine; a song originally done by Neil Diamond, UB-40 throws a reggae/ska feel onto it and it gives the song a life it didn’t have before. For the most part, it really is just a simple, straight-forward cover, but I think they do a good job of retaining the soul of the song with this transition. Not to mention Ali Campell’s great vocal performance, it’s just a well-composed cover, through-in-through.

    title: This Is How We Do It
    artist: Montell Jordan
    year: '1995'
    genres:
      - New jack swing
      - Hip hop
      - Soul
      - R&B
    commentary: THE party anthem of the ‘90s, it perfectly synthesizes the new jack swing sound of the early ‘90s with the golden-age hip hop of the mid-90s. A nice bridge between the smooth R&B of the likes of Boyz II Men with the gritty hip hop of the likes of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. However, even with the lyrical content sounding like it’s something Coolio would have wrote, it’s still family-friendly for radio play, and Montell Jordan’s smooth delivery is the icing on the cake. Let’s also not ignore the immaculate production quality; solid beat and piano-driven chord progression and the “this is how we do it!” refrain is too damn catchy to not sing.
  - position: 58
    title: Say It Right
    artist: Nelly Furtado
    year: '2007'
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: 'The best #1 hit of Timbaland’s career as a producer and easily Nelly Furtado’s best song. The entire song has this ethereal reverb effect that washes over the whole song and gives it this ghostly feel to it. Nelly Furtado’s haunting vocals and Timbaland’s distant-sounding adlibs really sell the feel of the song well. However, even with the indie-popish production, it remains very catchy with the drumline beat and singable chorus. To top it all off, the song fades out with an extremely tasteful electric guitar solo, sealing the deal on this song as one of the best of the ‘00s.'
  - position: 57
    title: Sleepwalk
    artist: Santo & Johnny
    year: '1959'
    genres:
      - Instrumental rock
      - Surf rock
    commentary: If one song could personify the act of sitting in a diner in the ‘50s drinking chocolate malts with your high school sweetheart, this would probably be the best candidate. However, the slow, swingy, ‘50s chord progression isn’t the only thing that defines this song. Never have I heard an instrumental with so much heart and soul poured into it; the combination of the steady electric guitar on rhythm and the tasteful steel pedal on lead makes for a sound that so full of emotion, you can feel it in your bones. The last few chords on electric guitar that finish the song are just so perfect; amazing instrumental work.
  - position: 56
    title: Waterfalls
    artist: TLC
    year: '1995'
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Hip hop
      - Soul
    commentary: 'The song that was #1 in the country the week I was born, and I’m not complaining. This soulful R&B song is quite hard to listen to, as it tackles some sad topics. The first verse describing the murder of a young teen selling drugs and the second verse the death of young man from AIDs; all of these stories are tied off with the soaring chorus “Don’t go chasing waterfalls, please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you’re used to, I know you’re gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you’re moving to fast.” It’s quite an emotional listen and the use of a steady drumbeat, slinky funk guitar, and dreamy electric organs really capture the emotion of the song very well. Not to mention’s Left-Eye’s amazing rap verse that ends the song on a hopeful message “Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you”.'
  - position: 55
    title: Another One Bites The Dust
    artist: Queen
    year: '1980'
    genres:
      - Funk rock
      - Disco
    commentary: I always love it when a band that usually sticks to one genre goes outside of their comfort zone to give us a banger in a completely different one. Queen were operatic rockers; they wrote these massive, epic songs with stories that were more of a fit for an opera/stage play and not a rock concert. However, In 1980, Queen busted out this hard rock number built around a simple, bad-ass bassline and they knocked it right out of the park. Freddie Mercury’s commanding vocal performance, Brian May’s funky guitar lead, and Roger Taylor’s steady 4-on-the-floor beat compliment Jon Deacon’s bassline so well. It’s when a band comes together and uses their strengths that we get songs like this.
  - position: 54
    title: More Than Words
    artist: Extreme
    year: '1991'
    genres:
      - Soft rock
      - Acoustic rock
    commentary: 'One of the last hair ‘80s metal ballads to reach #1, Extreme, a band that usually is at-home writing hyper-complicated speed metal songs with sweep-picked guitar solos, slows it down to a simple acoustic love song, and it’s just amazing. The soulful guitar chords combined with the amazing vocal harmonies by Gary Cherone and Nuno Bettencourt are just perfect here; another case of a group doing a song outside of their wheelhouse and nailing it. However, them being speed metalheads, they couldn’t help themselves. Right at the end of the song, we get an honest-to-God tapped and sweep-picked acoustic guitar solo by Bettencourt and to be frank, it’s fantastic. A song that has aged well in a genre that really hasn’t.'
  - position: 53
    title: Human
    artist: The Human League
    year: '1986'
    genres:
      - Synth-pop
      - Pop
      - Soul
    commentary: The magnum-opus of both The Human League and producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. This is the synth-pop song to end all synth-pop songs. Really, the reason why I placed this one so high is because of the synths themselves. They carry this song like how Atlas carries the Earth. The staggard, snappy percussion, the wash of twinkly keys and bass synths give the song a timbre that is truly unmatched, especially in the last 30 seconds of the song, it’s almost as if God composed it, it’s that good! It’s also worth mentioning Phillip Oakley and Joanne Catherall’s outstanding vocal performances; they play off each other so well here. It’s a shame that their careers plummeted shortly after the success of this record.

    title: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For
    artist: U2
    year: '1987'
    genres:
      - Rock
      - Gospel
    commentary: 'A song to lift one’s spirits up, that’s for sure. It’s so happy sounding with the bouncing bassline and ethereal guitar work by The Edge. Lead singer Bono also gives an outstanding performance; matches the tone of the song very well and the harmonies provided by the rest of the band follow suit. The lyrical content of the song is also pretty good.  It appears to be about a man going through a crisis of self. After enduring all his trials and tribulations, he “still hasn’t found what he’s looking for”. It can be interpreted in a many of ways, but my interpretation is quite hopeful: I think ultimately, we’re not supposed to find what we are looking for, but instead it’s what we need the most that finds us.'
  - position: 51
    title: Mr. Tambourine Man
    artist: The Byrds
    year: '1965'
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Jangle pop
    commentary: 'The one and only song written by Bob Dylan to reach #1, The Byrds bring us one of the best covers to come from the British Invasion era of rock (which is funny, because The Byrds were American). The somber vocal performances and harmonies provided by the band combined with those heavenly 12-string Rickenbacker guitars really put you in the headspace of America in the mid-60s. I think it’s also worth mentioning that during this time, many of the Beatles considered The Byrds to be the best band from America. It just goes to show you how talent can appreciate other talent. However, even this song is a far-cry in quality to the one other #1 hit, which we’ll be getting to much later (hint, hint, wink, wink).'
  - position: 50
    title: I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    year: '1982'
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Pop
      - Soft rock
    commentary: Never has a Roland drum machine sounded so good! If I had to pick one song to be the ambassador of the drum machine as an instrument, THIS would be the song I’d elect. Hall & Oates were masters of their craft, and they embraced the ‘80s sound with open arms. The drum beat and bassline for this song go sooooo hard, it’s not even funny. Take some tasteful synth stabs and runs and Daryl Hall’s buttery smooth vocals and you got yourself a hit to last the ages. During the recording of the star-powered charity single “We Are The World” in 1985, Michael Jackson walked up to Hall & Oates and personally thanked them for “letting him steal the bassline from ‘I Can’t Go For That’ for his song ‘Billie Jean’”. See, even MJ knew this was an instant classic and used it as inspiration for writing his own magnum-opus… oh yeah, and the saxophone solo by Charles DeChant is the greatest of all-time in pop music, nothing too special.

    title: You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'
    artist: The Righteous Brothers
    year: '1965'
    genres:
      - Pop
      - R&B
      - Blue-eyed soul
    commentary: Easily one of the best traditional pop songs of the ‘60s. What catapulted this song so high up the rankings for me are the vocal performances by Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield (Yes, believe it or not, they are not actually brothers). Medley’s bass-baritone and Hatfield’s Soprano-Tenor voices were a match made in heaven; one of the best vocal duos of all-time. The bridge section of this songs is what sends this song into the stratosphere. The call-response “Baby! Baby!” between the two with the symphonic build-up to the chorus is the stuff of legends.
  - position: 48
    title: Paint It, Black
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    year: '1966'
    genres:
      - Raga rock
      - Psychedelic rock
    commentary: 'I still can’t believe this song was written in 1966, let alone it being a #1 hit! The Rolling Stones were always the more edgy band to come from the British Invasion, but this dark and moody song they wrote in the middle of that movement is something that sounds like it could have been written in the ‘90s. During a time when most pop was still very bright and cheery, we get a song with lyrics about a man mourning the loss of his lover by picturing the whole world turning black. However, is it a good song on its own? Absolutely! The main riff performed by Keith Richards on the sitar adds a lot of moody timbre to the song and Charlie Watts pounding rhythm on the drums gives the song a primitive feel. The hummed outro is so well-done, you can’t help but hum along.'
  - position: 47
    title: Let's Dance
    artist: David Bowie
    year: '1983'
    genres:
      - Funk
      - New wave
      - Dance-rock
      - Post-disco
      - Dance-pop
      - Funk rock
    commentary: One of the best dance numbers of the ‘80s, by the man himself David Bowie. Considering Bowie’s artsy roots as a glam rocker, seeing him become a staple of the ‘80s pop movement was probably a shock to some. However, his eclectic tastes and talents basically guaranteed at least one hit from him during this era, and what we got was amazing. The funk on this track is undeniable, and Bowie gives us a vocal performance of a lifetime. The “under the moonlight, the serious moonlight” line is so damn good, as well as the rest of the lyrics. Of course, it would be a crime to not acknowledge the banger guitar work by Stevie Ray Vaughn on this song. Even Bowie could recognize talent beyond the genre he was working on and brought one of the best blues guitarists to ever live aboard to give this song its finishing touches.
  - position: 46
    title: Take On Me
    artist: a-ha
    year: '1985'
    genres:
      - Synth-pop
      - New wave
    commentary: Okay, THIS is the synth-pop song to end all synth-pop songs. Never have synths sounded so good and catchy. The main synthline is so damn good; the driving drum machines, and snappy basslines also add so much to this song. It’d be hard to ignore the fantastic vocal performance by Morten Harket; his voice suits the song very well, and the rising vocal line during the chorus is quite an impressive feat for any singer. My favorite part is easily the breakdown in the middle with those twinkly rising-and-falling chromatic scales played on the synths; just compositional bliss. You know, there was a lot of low-tier garbage that came from this genre… but these unsuspecting Norwegian new wavers came along in 1985 to set the standard for what makes a good synth-pop song and now, it’s a timeless classic.
  - position: 45
    title: One Sweet Day
    artist: Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men
    year: 1995/96
    genres:
      - R&B
    commentary: 'Although I have it ranked at #45, I will admit that this is probably the closest we are getting to the “perfect” pop song. The story behind this one is something out of a storybook. Mariah Carey was writing a song to celebrate the life of longtime friend and producer David Cole who died of AIDs in January 1995. She was already planning on collaborating with Boyz II Men, and the day they found themselves in the studio together, she showed them the chorus to this song. They were taken aback; it turns out they were writing basically the same song with a similar feel and lyrics. It was at this point they knew they had a hit on their hands and threw the kitchen sink at this one. What we got were the best performances of their careers, and a #1 hit that stayed at the top for 16 consecutive weeks. The slow, contemplative verses combined with the soaring and emotional choruses sound like something an angel would write. That feels like an appropriate descriptor, considering the gospel-like lyrical content.'
  - position: 44
    title: My Prerogative
    artist: Bobby Brown
    year: '1989'
    genres:
      - New jack swing
    commentary: 'The song that put new jack swing on the map, and a damn good ambassador of what a good new jack swing song sounds like. The snappy rhythm section, the swingy synths, the orchestral stabs, and Bobby Brown’s commanding presence over the song make this one of the funkiest songs of the late ‘80s. This was a much needed #1 hit, as most of the songs at this time were just slow, boring, and edgeless. I love the lyrical content of this song, it’s so in-your-face. It’s like… why do you care about what I do with my time and money? How about you go get bent and let me live the way I want to? Huh?!” The singable chorus really hammers this message home, and I love it.'
  - position: 43
    title: Stronger
    artist: Kanye West
    year: '2007'
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Electronica
    commentary: Let’s get this out of the way. This is probably one of the best samples ever used in a hip hop song. Kanye West’s decision to sample Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” was genius, and the down-tuned chorus combined with those pounding rhythms gives the listener the strength to charge into battle, no matter the odds of survival. This is also probably one of the best if not the best performance by West as well, he really commands this song and that chorus is sooooo damn good. I remember watching a mini-documentary about the album this song is on, “Graduation” being the turning point where the “crunk” era was replaced by style of Kanye West as the king of hip hop. So I guess I have this song to thank for ending the rein of a sub-genre that I just don’t like that much.
  - position: 42
    title: No Diggity
    artist: Blackstreet feat. Dr. Dre & Queen Pen
    year: '1996'
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Hip hop
      - New jack swing
    commentary: 'Speaking of bad-ass hip hop, this song is THE epitome of bad-assery. No hip hop song (or at least no #1 hip hop song) makes the listener feel like a bad-ass like this song. I think what makes this song so legendary is the immaculate production quality done by Dr. Dre. The snappy 4/4 rhythm, the sampling of “Grandma’s Hands” by Bill Withers, and those pounding piano bass notes at the end of each bar give the song a grit that sets it apart from the rest. Let’s talk about the verses. Every. Single. Verse. Is perfect. Dr. Dre’s commanding rap intro, Teddy Riley’s verse with those smooth vocals, Chauncey Hannibal’s nasally voice on the second verse, and Queen Pen’s closing verse is equally commanding as Dr. Dre’s. The harmonies on the chorus and the “hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-ooooohh” refrain is too catchy to not sing. If you’re a fan of the old soul of the ‘60s but never saw the appeal of hip hop, then I think this is the song that will turn you on it. A masterpiece of the genre.'
  - position: 41
    title: House of the Rising Sun
    artist: The Animals
    year: '1964'
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Blues rock
      - Proto-prog
    commentary: This song is quite a mystery. We have no clue who wrote it or where it came from. Some musicologist date the origins of this song back to 16th century England, with the earliest recording being from Appalachia in the 1930s. However, there is no denying that this song was done best by The Animals. They did what could be considered the impossible and took an old folk song and gave it the British Invasion treatment and made a rock number to last the ages. Everything about this song is just amazing. The arpeggiated guitar riff, Eric Burton’s powerful vocal performance (which was something new to pop music), and an absolutely legendary electric organ performance by Alan Price. He goes complete apeshit on this song, it’s so damn good. The way the song builds up in sound and timbre makes it sound like some proto metal song, and the final extended chord played on the organ finishes the song with a bang… oh yeah, this was in 1964 by the way. People were still getting used to The Beatles and here were The Animals making a song so huge in scope that it probably put people on their asses the first time they heard it.
  - position: 40
    title: Hello
    artist: Adele
    year: 2015/16
    genres:
      - Soul
    commentary: Adele’s magnum opus. It’s like she took the best qualities of her previous hits and filtered them into one perfect Adele song. Easily one of the best piano chord progressions I’ve ever heard. It’s so somber and emotional, it perfectly suits Adele’s soft and vulnerable vocals during the verses as well as her powerful and soulful cries for help during the choruses. It’s insane to think about how much effort she poured into this song; it’s so simple in its composition, and yet so epic sounding; Top-notch production quality, that’s for sure.
  - position: 39
    title: You Haven't Done Nothin'
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    year: '1974'
    genres:
      - Funk
    commentary: 'My favorite Stevie Wonder song and probably the single most explicitly political song to reach #1; this one’s a scathing critique of President Richard Nixon, who ironically resigned just two days after the release of this song. Coincidence? Maybe. However, it’s political message is NOT the reason why I ranked this song so high. It’s because it’s an absolute funk overload, that’s why! This is easily his most funky song he’s ever written. The simple broomstick rhythm is paired well with a very percussive clavinet riff played by Wonder, and the horns that pop in and out of the song compliment the composition well. Let’s also not ignore the extremely catchy “doo da wop!” refrain provided by the Jackson 5 after each chorus.'
  - position: 38
    title: Respect
    artist: Arthra Franklin
    year: '1967'
    genres:
      - Soul
    commentary: 'When I was listening to the R&B #1 hits of the ‘60s, I was surprised how little edge each hit had… and then I got to this one. Like, I can’t tell you how much more power and soul this song has over anything The Supremes ever did, or any of the other ‘60s R&B songs I had to listen to for this project, and to be frank, I don’t think I every heard a song to match the commanding presence Aretha Franklin has over this song. Throw in a tasteful tenor sax solo by Curtis Ousley and some outstanding backing vocals by her sisters, and you got one hell of a soul song.'
  - position: 37
    title: That's What I Like
    artist: Bruno Mars
    year: '2017'
    genres:
      - Hip hop soul
      - New jack swing
      - R&B
      - Funk
    commentary: Bruno Mars and company do the impossible on this song, writing and composing what I think is the best ‘90s-style R&B song every written. It’s so undeniably smooth in its delivery, and combined with that top-notch 21st century production quality, it puts everything from the decade it’s honoring to shame. I could go into detail about all of the tasteful callbacks to the acts of the ‘90s or the clever lyrics, but instead I’ll just implore you to listen to the song yourself and see what makes this one great.
  - position: 36
    title: I Heard It Through the Grapevine
    artist: Marvin Gaye
    year: 1968/69
    genres:
      - Soul
      - R&B
    commentary: 'The single most bad-ass sounding R&B #1 hit of the ‘60s. Marvin Gaye really gives it his all on this one, and it shows. Hardly anyone could match the passion he brought to his songs. The electric organ riff that acts as the backbone for this song sounds so metal, I would like to imagine that Black Sabbath probably listened to this song to death as inspiration for some of their songs. I also really like those soft backing vocals by The Andantes’, it’s almost as if they are gossiping on the other side of said grapevine, which is extremely fitting considering the lyrical content of the song. Sometimes even a simple song like this one can tell a story and be an experience in of itself.'
  - position: 35
    title: Royals
    artist: Lorde
    year: '2013'
    genres:
      - Art pop
      - Electropop
    commentary: 'A sleeper hit from 2013, this artsy indie pop song is really the perfect case study of how to make a minimal-sounding pop song. A basic bassline with some occasional synths, a simple drum machine beat, throw some reverb over everything, and let Lorde’s voice carry the rest of the song and boy does her voice carry this song. Despite being only 16 years old at the time of recording, her voice is so rich in it’s sound and timbre, that she sounds like an elder soul singer with many years of experience. Another great thing about this song is the lyrics. They are so tongue-in-cheek and yet clever in its message: “But every song’s like: ‘Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin’ in the bathroom, Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin’ the hotel room’, We don’t care, we’re driving Cadillacs in our dreams” It’s like she’s mocking the materialistic lyrics of modern pop while wishing she could enjoy the same things without the implication of being materialistic. Some real “between a rock and a hard place” stuff.'
  - position: 34
    title: Don't You (Forget About Me)
    artist: Simple Minds
    year: '1985'
    genres:
      - New wave
      - Pop rock
      - Synth-pop
    commentary: “Here lies Phillip J. Fry… named after his uncle… to carry on his spirit.” If you get this reference, then you may start to get teary-eyed. That’s the power this song has on people. This seemingly “simple” new wave, pop rock song is much more than just a feel-good summer hit used in the film “The Breakfast Club”, it’s a testament to spirit and emotion of the ‘80s. The “don’t you forget about me” refrain during the chorus is almost like the ‘80s decade itself is calling out to us; to get us to remember the magic of the decade. If I had to pick one song as the ambassador of the ’80s, I’d be this one hands down.
  - position: 33
    title: Money For Nothing
    artist: Dire Straits
    year: '1985'
    genres:
      - Pop rock
    commentary: 'There’s a spectacular irony in the message of this song. The lyrics are all about some blue-collar workers complaining that they have to bust their ass to make a living while these MTV rock stars are getting “money for nothing”. This of course, is coming from the pen of a band that helped define the ‘80s MTV generation. However, this is more of a friendly ribbing towards Dire Straits because no amount of irony can tear down the banger of a rock track this song is. The soft, contemplative synth intro with Sting singing those angelic lyrics “I want my MTV”; this all builds up, with a drum solo and all, to one of the most bad-ass guitar riffs ever composed. Nothing gets my hyped up more than hearing that riff get blasted through my speakers. However, once the song reaches this climax, it stays there for the remainder of the song with a perfect blend of blue rock and synth-pop to carry us to the end with Sting coming back with those lyrics: “I want my MTV”.'

    title: Hey Ya!
    artist: Outkast
    year: 2003/04
    genres:
      - Soul
      - Funk
      - Pop
    commentary: "The single best crossover hit of recent memory, appealing to hip hop fans, R&B fans, pop fans, rock fans, electronic fans, the whole gamut. However, don’t let that fool you. The breadth of appeal this song does not take away from the depth this song has. The countdown intro rockets quickly into the catchy hook of the song with an acoustic guitar driving it. The use of only major chords (the “happy” sounding ones) for the main riff, the upbeat drumbeat, and the catchy “Hey, ya!” refrain is completely contrasted by the down-right depressing lyrical content of the song. I mean, just take the second verse: “You think you've got it, but ‘got it’ just don't get it till there's nothing at all. We get together, but separate's always better when there's feelings involved. If what they say is, ‘Nothing is forever’ Then what makes love the exception? So why are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here? Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance…” I think that last line really says it all."

    title: With or Without You
    artist: U2
    year: '1987'
    genres:
      - Rock
    commentary: One of the most cliché tropes of pop music is the use of the “4 chords” progression. You might not know what this is, but if you look it up on YouTube, you’ll immediately recognize it. It’s usually viewed as a cheap way to write a pop song, but when it’s done right, it can make a song sound legendary. Bono and company did exactly that when they made this song. This is the single best use of the “4 chords” I’ve ever heard. It suits the contemplative and depressing feel of the song so well. The way the song builds up in sound, with Bono starting us off with a simple spoken word verse which leads into him belting out the chorus, and the fantastic intro of The Edge on guitar with that ethereal and legendary delay pedal riff. The song continues to build up in sound until it climaxes with the soaring vocals of Bono on the final chorus. The song closes us off with The Edge giving us a simple and yet emotional guitar coda that mirrors the “4 chords” the song is built around.

    commentary: 'The hardest rockin’ song to ever reach #1, and it will probably never be topped. This is hands-down my favorite instrumental #1 hit, and I still can’t believe this was a #1 hit. It’s like America just decided one day that they like heavy metal enough to send this proggy instrumental to the top of the charts. This song is like one big exercise of technical mastery; just when you think the song is slowing down, Edgar Winter throws in another damn instrument to shred on. First, it’s the guitar work by Ronnie Montrose, then it’s the keyboards by Edgar Winter, and then we get a damn saxophone solo by Winter, and then it evolves into an honest-to-God drum battle between Chuck Ruff on the kit and Winter on the timbales, AND THEN ANOTHER keyboard solo by Winter, AND THEN FINALLY a chaotic breakdown by Winter on the ARP 2600 synthesizer. The band called the song “Frankenstein” because during the initial recording of the track, they had so many spliced tapes of each instrument just draped over tables and furniture that it was like assembling Frankenstein’s monster. However, this is not just some hyper-composed instrumental track that was made for the studio. If you go on YouTube, you can find a live performance of this song from a TV show, and no joke, they perform it NOTE FOR NOTE on all the previously mentioned instruments. Insane amount of talent from these guys!'

    genres:
      - Power pop
      - New wave
    commentary: Just when I was getting tired of listening to all the disco and slow, boring, piano ballads of the late ‘70s, The Knack comes along and blows everyone else out of the water with this hard rock number. The song starts us off with a thundering, primal drumbeat which leads into the massively catchy and powerful guitar riff that drives this song. I cannot put into words how bad-ass the main guitar riff for this song is, just see for yourself. That’s not the only thing that’s great about the guitar in this song; there’s not one, but TWO guitar solos. The first one is punchy and hard; a nice addition to the driving power of the main riff and just when you think the song is coming to an end, the song changes key and what we get next is one of the greatest guitar solos of all-time by Berton Averre. The technically on display is one thing, but the solo fits the groove of the song so well. Easily my favorite one-hit wonder on all-time.

    genres:
      - R&B
    commentary: The best R&B group of the ‘90s, no one could match the unique, smooth timbre of the harmonies of Boyz II Men, and I think this was their best song from this era of music. The slow, waltz rhythm with the twinkly keys are the perfect supplement to each of the singer’s solo verses and the harmonies during the choruses are just… perfect. The vocal transition into each chorus by Wanya Morris is something of legends. Easily the best part of the song is the interlude with the whole group singing “Lonely… Lonely…” while Morris belts out the last line of the pre-chorus. I wish I had more to say about this song, but it’s really just an extremely well-made song with a simple, straight-forward song, and I think it’s its simplicity that makes it so great.

    commentary: This song has become sort of a meme amongst young folks, like how “Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Astley did, but I’m gonna sound like a total hipster and say that “I liked it before it became a meme”. This is a masterpiece of pop rock composition. It’s the perfect blend of the ‘70s rock sound and the newer synth pop of the ‘80s. The geographical topic of the song is manifested in a top-notch use of congas, marimbas, shakers, and a tasteful collection of synths. On top of that, we get a fantastic vocal performance by both David Paich during the verses and Bobby Kimball during the chorus. The lyrics are also quite well-written, with a bit of vagueness to give the listener the power to interpret it however they want. The harmonies during the last chorus are just out of this world and end the song on a powerful note.

    genres:

    commentary: 'This is another one of those “how the hell did this reach #1?” songs. It’s insane to think that this moody, artsy fartsy, indie pop breakup song at one point was the most popular song in the America. It’s surprisingly a simple song, with a minimal, shuffle rhythm with acoustic guitars and an honest-to-God xylophone riff. After the first verse, we get another addition to the basic rhythm with a marching snare and some simple, tasteful synths. However, this song goes from 0 to 100 quick when Gotye belts out that instantly catchy and powerful chorus; that alone sent this song way up the rankings for me. Then we get an amazing vocal performance by Kimbra on the last verse, giving her side of the story. The song is then wrapped up with another fantastic chorus with pitch-perfect harmonies by Kimbra to match Gotye’s lines. It’s almost like they are arguing and talking over each other in song form. It’s a shame that Gotye practically disappeared after this hit; it’s like he’s now… somebody that we used to know.'

    commentary: THE magnum opus of ‘80s pop and easily MJ’s best song. Out of all of the songs on this list, this one has, hands-down, the best intro. The simple 4/4 drum rhythm with that tight snare drum, followed by the funky bassline and then followed by those softly stabbed synth lines is composition perfection. Of course, Jackson’s vocal performance is what carries this song into legendary status. Combined with his iconic ad-libs, Jackson’s vulnerable and somber vocals are tinged with a vibrato that is unmatched. That’s just the verses; when the pre-chorus and chorus come up, Jackson’s belting performance wakes us all up and ups-the-ante that this groove is rolling. Throw in a banger of a funk guitar solo in the middle and the “Billie Jean is not my lover!” refrain throughout, and you got one of the best pop songs of the ‘80s.

    year: '1986'
    genres:
      - Rock
      - Soft Rock
    commentary: "A song with a political message; this song is about the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with each verse being a microcosm of the attitudes of the day. “Standin' in line, marking time, waiting for the welfare dime… 'cause they can't buy a job. The man in the silk suit hurries by as he catches the poor old lady's eyes. Just for fun, he says: ‘Get a job’” The somber stories are contrasted by the hopeful message of “don’t believe them” when they say “that’s just the way it is”. I haven’t even gotten to the composition of the song. The driving drum beat with the synthy bassline, matching guitar lines and the piano on this song… oh my, the piano on this song… no #1 hit rocks as hard as this one does on the piano. I put this song so high up on the list solely because of the virtuoso-level performance by Bruce Hornsby. From the main line to the somber descending riff during the chorus, to the amazing solo in the middle, he really gives his 110% on this one, and I don’t think there will ever be a #1 hit to match the piano skills of this song."

    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Afrobeat
      - Trap
    commentary: 'What I love most about this song is how much of a “bait-and-switch” it is. The catchy afrobeat intro brings you in with its laid back and happy sound, and then “bam!” it’s all killed off with a single gunshot, a hypnotic, oscillating bassline, and the line sung by Donald Glover: “This is America… don’t catch you slippin’ now.” This is another explicitly political song. This one covers everything from police brutality, mass shootings, race relations, etc. all with a simple, trap rap, flow by Glover. It does bring back the afrobeat in the second verse, but once again it is killed off by gunshots and the line: “This is America… don’t catch you slippin’ now.” However, the two sounds blend on the last verse to tie the whole song together, and perhaps leave the song on a positive note. However, the erratic kick drum pattern and shrill synth line that fades the song out indicate to the listener that there are still problems in America to fix. I can’t help but love a song that is this provocative.'

    artist: Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories
    year: '1994'
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Pop rock
    commentary: 'This song has an interesting story. Lisa Loeb was just like many aspiring acoustic folk artists living in New York City, and then a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity fell into her lap. Her neighbor, actor Ethan Hawke, was in the middle of making the rom-com film “Reality Bites” when he suggested to her to record one of her songs for the film’s soundtrack. At this time, she wasn’t even signed to a record label, but she went through with it, and it became an instant hit and is the only folk-rock song to hit #1 in the ‘90s, right in between #1 hits from All-4-One and Boyz II Men. However, Is it any good? It absolutely is. The main, ascending riff on the acoustic guitar is so hopeful in its sound, it’s can inspire. It really kicks into gear when the laid-back rhythm on the drum kit and those slinky strummed chords come in. Loeb’s vocals are also on-point. She sings with complete vulnerability raising her voice occasionally; it really suits the lyrical content about her wrestling with her feelings of regret and wanting her lover to “stay”. The whole song is actually quite unique in it’s composition, as there is no “verse-chorus-bridge” structure, it just sort of continuously rising in intensity until it ends with the ascending guitar riff and the somber line “You say… I only hear what I want to.”'

    genres:

      - Synth-pop
    commentary: My favorite pop act of the ‘80s, these guys were more than just catchy songwriters. They were though-provoking; they were intellectual, and this song is the perfect synthesis of ‘80s synth-pop and high-minded poetry. The abstract lyrics tackle the feeling of power and how much people want it and how it can hurt others… all while we listen to a colorful collage of synths that wash over us with the warmth of a fireplace. The hummed intro with that guitar riff and the way it flows into the shuffled drum machine beat and the contemplative main synth line is amazing, and the chorus is infectiously catchy. The instrumental break before the first guitar solo with the hummed vocals give me goosebumps every time I listen to it. Both guitar solos complement the synths so well that it almost makes you forget that this is a song laced with imagery of the fear of Cold War nuclear annihilation. In fact, during the first gulf war, this song was banned on British radio stations as to not demoralize the troops with its political themes. Funny… this is the one song I think of the most when I think of the first gulf war. Strange how that happens.

    artist: The Byrds
    year: '1965'
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Jangle pop
    commentary: 'My favorite song to come from the British Invasion era of rock, which is funny since The Byrds are American. At one point, the Beatles thought they were the best band to come from America, so I guess they have they’re blessing. What to say about this song? Oh, so much! For its origins, it’s probably the oldest song to reach #1, as the lyrics to this song are ripped straight from the King James Bible, Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, with some re-wording and creative liberties taken here and there. The composition itself was done by Folk artist Pete Seeger, and with his blessing, allowed The Byrds to record their own version and what we got was easily one of the best folk-rock songs ever recorded. It’s a case of the perfect song at the right time: In 1965, America was going through some hard times. The Vietnam War had just started, The Civil Rights movement was in full swing, and Cold War tensions were very high. This song, with its somber tone and distinct sound was the perfect reflection of the feelings many Americans had at this time. “A time of love, a time of hate, A time of war, a time of peace… a time you may embrace, a time to refrain from embracing.” A lot of people tend to think of this song as “one of those songs you hear in a movie when a scene takes place in the ‘60s”, but it is so much more than that. Case in point: the guitar on this song. As a guitarist, I wish I could put into words how amazing the Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar sounds. Despite the implication, the guitar is actually played like a standard 6-string guitar, but has a second, thinner string closely strung next to each of the standard strings. Those thinner strings are tuned to the exact pitch of the string it’s paired with but because it’s thinner, it gives you a different timbre and when played together, it gives you an amazing “jangly” sound. The “jangle” sound on this song is unmatched in my opinion, especially during the instrumental break in the middle; the wash of multiple Rickenbackers playing at once really captures the somber feeling of the song, like a time capsule from the 1965. I implore you folks to revisit this song and take a good listen: this is a masterpiece of folk rock.'

    title: Another Day in Paradise
    artist: Phil Collins
    year: 1989/90
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: "Phil Collins has always been one of favorite solo pop artists, mainly due to the fact that he was the original drummer from the prog rock band Genesis and their lead singer after Peter Gabriel left in 1974. I always thought that his solo act songs were a nice combination of Prog Rock aesthetic and Pop sensibilities, even if he leaned more into the pop side of things. Some heads will write off this era of Collins and ‘80s Genesis as “bad” and a “betrayal” to their original catalogue but I always though their embrace of the ‘80s sound to be pretty graceful and tasteful. Many of his Collins’ hits were good, but nothing can match the immaculate composition of this song from the tail-end of his pop stardom. This song comes from his 1989 album “…But Seriously”, named so due to the much more “serious” topics being tackled in its lyrical content compared to his poppy-er, catchier, albums from before. This song in particular tackles the issue of homelessness. The whole song’s composition is eerily fitting for the topic at hand, with the intro made up of ominous synths and various instruments to set the tone, followed by some light guitar motifs and Collins’ iconic gated reverb snare drum. This all leads into the main groove of the song, made up of a simple drum beat and synth/guitar line that oozes the smooth feel of the R&B of the time. The restricted synth line and guitar motifs come back during the verses, which pairs well with the lyrics of the song: “You can tell from the lines on her face, you can see that she's been there. Probably been moved on from every place, 'cause she didn't fit in there.” Another thing I didn’t know before this project was that David Crosby provided backing vocals on this song, which is just cool. This song was a very strong way to end the ‘80s decade of music and a very strong way to usher in the ‘90s for pop. ‘Tis a shame that Phil Collins couldn’t carry on that success into the new decade."

    commentary: 'An unsuspecting hit for 1984, but nonetheless a massive breakout success for Prince. At this point, he was already an established force behind the “Minneapolis Sound” movement, but this is when he got HUGE. This wasn’t just a #1 hit, but also the most successful #1 hit of 1984, topping the year-end chart for that year. Did he deserve the success? Absolutely. This is easily one of the most catchy and danceable hits of the ‘80s, and he managed to pull that off without using any bass at all. Seriously, this is probably the catchiest you can get without any low-end, and I doubt any artist will be able to top this song with the same formula. This song is really the embodiment of the old phrase: “less is more”. That if you compose the instrumentation the right way, you won’t even need more than two or three instruments. However, I am heavily biased in putting this song so high up the rankings because it has one of the most banger intros for a song I’ve ever heard. The song hits you like a Mac truck right out of the gate with an amazing, distorted guitar solo – a barrage of shred guitar combined with the undeniably catchy drum machine hook. This is then followed by Prince’s guttural, vocally fried “yeah… yeah… yeah… yeah…” which leads into the song’s main synth line. The rest of the song is quite literally just the drum machine and Prince’s vocals, with only the synths coming back during the pre-chorus and chorus – “less is more”. The lyrics have a neat juxtaposition of being very seductive in nature while also being ominously vague: “Dream, if you can, a courtyard, an ocean of violets in bloom. Animals strike curious poses; they feel the heat… the heat between me and you.” However, the song does rise in tension and power during the last chorus with Prince belting out an amazing vocal run with those rising synths behind it. A fantastic way to end the song… or so it would seem. Many people have only ever heard the single version of this song, but if you listen to the album version, the song is extended by a SECOND banger shred guitar solo, an amazing vocal high-note by Prince, and a classical, baroque-style synth solo, along with the proper outro most people are familiar with. People tend to miss out on the best a song has to offer, because radio stations only want to play songs that are short and quick. However, radio stations WILL play “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen which is 6 minutes long, but not the FULL version of this song which is also 6 minutes!? Give me a break…'

    commentary: |-
      Two Prince songs in a row? And in the top 20? Of course! After all, he was quite the songwriter. Yes, this massive hit from 1990 was given to Sinéad O'Connor by Prince, and honestly I don’t think he could have ever done this song justice the way she does on this one. This is probably one of the most heart-wrenching break-up songs ever recorded, and that is all thanks to O’Connor’s tearful vocal performance. Seriously, watch the music video, she’s literally crying. She may have been thinking of her recently passed father when that was recorded, but the emotion carries into the song’s topic too well for it to not be genuine. The rest of the song’s composition also suit the theme of the song well as well. The extended church organ chords and strings with the steady ‘90s drum beat and those ominous backing vocals, it’s quite chilling to listen to. The lyrics are simple, but very powerful; really captures the desperation to re-kindle a relationship that seems doomed. “It's been seven hours and 15 days…
      since you took your love away.” She’s literally counting the hours since the breakup. THAT is some desperate behavior. Or maybe perhaps the second verse’s lyrics? “It's been so lonely without you here, like a bird without a song. Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling… tell me baby, where did I go wrong? I could put my arms around every boy I see… but they'd only remind me of you.” The whole song just oozes heartbreak, and frankly, it’s not a very fun song to listen to... That’s what makes it so good! Sometimes the best art isn’t the kind that makes you happy, but the kind that makes you sad.

    commentary: 'The single greatest soft rock song to ever be recorded, and probably the single most underrated hit from the ‘70s. Why were these guys relegated to a B-list pop act? These guys were amazing songwriters! “Everything I Own”, “Aubrey”, “Baby I’m-a Want You”, and “Guitar Man” are masterpieces of soft rock, where’s the retrospective accolades?! Maybe in the future, people will recognize the brilliance of this band, but in the meantime, I’ll be celebrating this song by putting it at #16 on my list. For this song, they really put the “soft” into soft rock. Everything about it, the quiet vocal performance by David Gates, the breezy acoustic guitar, the tasteful electric guitar licks, the string accompaniment, the tight drum kit, down to even it’s lyrics… EVERYTHING is so softly performed and expertly composed, that it is bound to put your mind at ease and relax your muscles. It’s like a warm bubble bath or a foot massage; it’s the most therapeutic song I’ve ever heard. I wish I could say more about it but it really is something you just gotta hear for yourself.'

    artist: The Police
    year: '1983'
    genres:
      - New wave
      - Soft rock
    commentary: "One of the most misunderstood songs in pop history. When Sting is singing the lyrics “I’ll be watching you”, he means that literally. Like… he’s watching you change out of your clothes through your bedroom window, and yet there has been many-a father-daughter dances at weddings set to this tune. However, the voyeuristic subject matter doesn’t take away from this somber new wave ballad. In fact, it adds so much to it. The starting major-chord guitar arpeggios played by Andy Summers make it feel like a love song, but then the very next chord arpeggio is dissonant and in a minor key, to remind the listener that this song is MUCH more sinister than meets the ear. This is paired excellently with a steady bassline by Sting, a simple drum pattern by Steward Copeland. Sting then adds the icing on the cake with a solid vocal performance. Especially on that bridge, when he belts out the lyrics: “Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace. I dream at night; I can only see your face. I look around, but it's you I can't replace. I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace. I keep crying baby… baby… please…” After this early climax, the song is then dotted with some pleasant piano bits and some eerily hummed vocals, until we reach the outro, where Sting repeats the line “I’ll be watching you…” as the rest of the band sings the main verse lines, and the instrumentation fades us out. As an addendum, this song is a beginner’s trap for young guitarists. It sounds like it would be easy to play, what with some simple-sounding arpeggios, but once you look at the chords and the finger placement… oh boy… get ready to develop some early-life carpal tunnel. However, once you get it down, it’s a ton of fun to play. Never lose hope!"

    title: Set Adrift on Memory Bliss
    artist: P.M. Dawn
    year: '1991'
    genres:
      - Alternative hip hop
    commentary: 'In the early ‘90s, hip hop was evolving quickly out of its early roots, as many different sub-genres took root all over the U.S. The most popular of these was easily gangsta rap from the west coast, as the likes of Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Doggy Dog among many others were charting pretty high and on a regular basis. However, it was a little duo from New Jersey that would score the first proper hip hop #1 of the decade. P.M. Dawn were part of a movement up in the New York/New Jersey scene of alternative hip hop, that broke from the standard “braggadocious” styles of rap in favor of a more philosophical and introspective style. Groups like A Tribe Called Quest, Digible Planets, and Digital Underground were among them. Although not a full-on alt hip hop act, P.M. Dawn’s #1 hit is still an amazing song of the genre. This song makes good use of the main hook sample of Spandau Ballet’s song “True” played alongside an angelic vocal harmony by the duo, Prince Be and DJ Minutemix. Throw in a damn-good catchy hip hop beat and some lightly dissonant percussion, and you have everything you need for a banger of an alt hip hop song. The song’s lyrical content is half Prince Be singing about a girl he saw in a dream and half a love-letter to then-contemporary actress Christina Applegate. It’s kinda wholesome how unapologetic he is on this one. It’s like he’s a boy singing to his crush, trying to get her to like him. Before I started this project, I never had heard this song, but after hearing it for the first time, I knew I had to place it high on the list. It sounds like what it would feel like to stand under a crystal-clear waterfall and let it wash you clean of your worries in life. There really isn’t anything on this list that feels like this one does.'

    commentary: 'If I had to rank these #1 hits by quality of the production, composition, and mixing, this song would crush every other song on this list. This is THE greatest synthesis of expert musicality and pop appeal. I don’t think there will ever be a pop song this well-crafted for a long while. This song had an interesting story. Originally when it was released, this British neo-soul song was hardly promoted and was quickly forgotten about by American listeners. However, it was film-maker Joel Schumacher who, in the middle of directing Batman Forever, petitioned to have this song included in the film. This was the catalyst that brought Seal’s talent into the spotlight, and it became an instant hit, and deservingly so. I really wish I could put into words how complex and multi-layered this song is, but I don’t have to. If you look up “Rick Beato Seal” on YouTube, you’ll see a great breakdown of the composition of the song, as well as an interview with Seal himself talking about what the song means to him. If I did have anything to say, it’s that this song has a truck load of POWER and PASSION, and hardly any song on this list can match it.'

    commentary: 'Imagine It’s 1985, and your friend rushes to your house to tell you of this awesome song he just heard on the radio called “Shout”. He describes what it sounds like, and It piques your interest enough for you to roll on down to the closest record store and find it. The main clerk then hands you “Songs From The Big Chair” by Tears For Fears. You look at the album cover and immediately think that your friend just played a practical joke on you. What the hell is this? An Easy-listening jazz album? The front cover looks like a Christmas card you get from your gay neighbors (well, this is in the mid-80s, so I guess this part of the story is less likely to have happened). Despite the lame appearance of the front cover, the clerk tells you it’s good, and so you bring it home to listen to it, and the first track that plays is sure-enough “Shout”. 6 minutes later, you are sitting there questioning what the hell you just experienced. Either that, or you are ready to go out into the streets to tear shit up and rebel! This song was placed so high up on the list because it goes… so… HARD! It’s sounds like some long-lost Nine Inch Nails song that was made a good 5 years before they were ever known. This song is basically the beginning of ‘90s Industrial Metal if you ask me. Everything from the snappy drum machine loop, the ominous synths, the rebellious refrain of “Shout! Shout! Let it all out! These are the things I can do without, so come on!”, it’s got the grit and angst of a ‘90s rock staple… in 1985! And it was a #1 hit! The whole song is just one big build up, with every verse adds a new layer of angst, alongside the fitting lyrics about standing up and raising hell; there’s even a funky-as-hell breakdown in the middle which leads into an electric organ and digital bassline! It’s like every step of the song is a point-by-point argument as to why you shouldn’t be complacent and to stand up against the man! Just when you think it couldn’t get any more bad-ass, Roland Orzabal gives us one of the greatest guitar solos of all-time. The Shout solo is one of the few solos that give me chills and goosebumps at the same time; it is so extremely fitting for the song and is the ultimate prize for following along. This is the ultimate call-to-action; protest all that is wrong with the world! Shout!'

    commentary: 'When Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars came together in 2014, they were on one mission: to create the “perfect” funk song… and they succeeded. Yes, even comparing it to the classics that it set out to emulate, I honestly think they overcame their greatness. This is basically the “Stairway to Heaven” of funk. It perfectly blends the sounds of early funk in the ‘60s all the way up to the Minneapolis funk of the ‘80s. Not a single second of this song is wasted. Every little start/stop, lyric, instrument, and ad-lib is perfectly placed to drive the song into funk overload. Easily the best part of this song is the rising build-up to each chorus with the “Don’t believe me, just watch!” refrain at the drop and those piercing synths overlayed the horn section lead. There’s not much else to say here; if you grew up in the ‘60s, ‘70s, or ‘80s, and you liked the funk of the day, then I highly recommend you check this song out.'

    title: Dreams
    artist: Fleetwood Mac
    year: '1977'
    genres:
      - Soft rock
    commentary: 'If there is one song that lives up to its title on this list, it’s this one. Never has a pop song been so dreamy in its composition. It sounds so big and yet, it is so simple in its structure. This song was written by lead vocalist Stevie Nicks in a single night during a time in Fleetwood Mac’s career when thing was not going well at all. Guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and she were separating, drummer Mick Fleetwood was going through a divorce and bassist John Mcvie and his wife, singer Christiane Mcvie, were separating as well. You’d think that this tension amongst the band would lead to disaster in the studio but somehow, they all managed to harness that negative energy into a collective, creative output that resulted in one of the best albums of the 1970s: “Rumours”. Hell, If I did a ranking of the best #1 albums of all time from the Billboard 200 chart, this would easily be my top spot. This song, “Dreams”, was the second single off the album and their only #1 hit. Everything from the steady 4/4 drum beat and bassline, the fade-in/fade-out ethereal guitar work sprinkled throughout the song, Stevie Nicks haunting vocals, and that soaring chorus with everyone singing harmonized backup vocals is just… perfect. There really isn’t anything I can complain about; even the production quality is top-notch! The funny thing is that this isn’t even the best song off the album (“The Chain” pretty much blows everything else out of the water if you ask me). That just goes to show you the talent Fleetwood Mac had in their prime. At a time when everyone was making quick-buck disco hits, Fleetwood Mac were expertly crafting songs that would be remembered throughout the years.'

    title: Sledgehammer
    artist: Peter Gabriel
    year: '1986'
    genres:
      - Dance-rock
      - Blue-eyed soul
      - Funk
    commentary: 'Another massive crossover hit of the ‘80s, and a damn fine example of blending genres to make one hell of a banger. In 1974, Peter Gabriel left the prog rock band, Genesis, to start a solo career of his own. He was more interested in making artsy rock music while Genesis wanted to stick to the early ‘70s prog rock sound. Ironically, both of them would go one to have massive pop successes with both of them having #1 hits literally next to each other (Genesis’ “Invisible Touch” was #1 the week before “Sledgehammer” hit the top of the charts). However, while Genesis (and Phil Collins respectively) went hard into to softening their sound to have to most pop appeal, Gabriel for the most part stuck to his art rock roots and constantly made music that blended artsy experimentation with catchy pop rhythms and melodies. Songs like “Solsbury Hill”, “Biko”, “Games Without Frontiers”, and “Shock The Monkey” are all great examples. “Sledgehammer” however, is his best work in this regard, in my opinion. In typical Peter Gabriel fashion, the song starts us off with an alluring flourish of a shakuhachi flute to draw us in… and then he hits us that horn section and an undeniably funky groove, pair with a solid bassline, simple drumbeat, and appropriate guitar lick! The groove gets even more nasty during the chorus when the “Sledgehammer!” refrain kicks in. However, the ultimate groove hits you at the climax of the song when the shakuhachi flute returns as an addendum to the instrumentation, and Peter Gabriel, along with a soulful choir, belts out a commanding set of lyrics to fade us out. Truly a moment of bad-assery in funk music. Oh yeah, and that’s without mentioning the amazing music video that goes along with this song. Very clever and creative use of Claymation and stop-motion animation, much deserving of all its accolades throughout the years. When it comes to crossover #1 hits, this is undeniably the best one out of them all – An excellent blending of worldbeat, funk, new wave, and art rock.'

    title: Hey Jude
    artist: The Beatles
    year: '1968'
    genres:
      - Pop rock
    commentary: 'This is THE Beatles piano ballad. There is hardly a Beatles song that better encapsules the poppy, singable, whimsical, and hopeful in a single package better then this one. Written by Paul McCartney, this one’s about John Lennon’s son Jules, who was just a little boy when his parents were going through a nasty divorce. McCartney was visiting Jules one day, and feeling bad for the kid, wrote the song on the car ride home. The lyrics are really some of the best “simple” lyrics you can get from a pop song; it’s directly pointed towards Jules: “Hey Jude… don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better. Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better. Hey Jude… don’t be afraid. You were made to go out and get her. The minute you let her under your skin, then you begin… to make it better.” Sung along with those somber, and yet hopeful and optimistic piano chords really tugs at the heart strings. Throw in some tambourines and Ringo on the kit (and in the pocket as well!) and you got yourself an anthem of hope. However, what makes this song is the epic is it’s coda section. With Paul climbing up the scale with “better, better, better, better, better…” and then hitting that impressive high note on that scream is very impressive. Then, we are treated to the group sung “nah… nah, nah, nana na nah! Nana na nah! Hey Jude!” lyric for the last 4 minutes. Yeah, the real meat of the song is only about 3 minutes long, but if I had to rank the “filler” of this song, this would easily be the best damn filler of a song to ever been recorded. The way the whole band leans into it and carries the song into the clouds… it just gives you a warm feeling inside when you sing along, as if everything is gonna be alright. I hope Jules found peace in his parents’ separation, and I hope he found comfort in the words of his loving and sincere “uncle” Paul.'

    title: American Pie
    artist: Don McLean
    year: '1972'
    genres:
      - Folk rock
    commentary: 'Originally, this song wasn’t even included on my list when I finished the project. Somehow, this song got lost in the mix of things, and I have no clue as to why; this is a masterpiece of storytelling and of folk rock. Until just a few weeks ago, this was the longest song to be a #1 hit, clocking in at 8 minutes 42 seconds. You’d think a real song like this one would be far from a big hit; pop audiences tend to only like short, quick songs they can dance to, but this song bucks this trend HARD. I think that’s because this song is just so ENGAGING. It’s not just some folksy song with vague lyrics and an esoteric message, it’s a song that uses clever little vignettes to tell the story of “The Day The Music Died” which was an actual event in U.S. History: February 3, 1959. A plane carrying early rock and roll stars Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and “The Big Bopper” J.P. Richardson crashed in Iowa, killing all three. This was a particularly devastating event because at the time, rock didn’t have too many stars and when three of the biggest ones die all in the same day, one can see why this was so tragic. Each vignette (or verse) is told from the perspective of different people of that day and of the culture leading up to the present day of 1972, and it’s not done in some plain-Jane “I was working at a Woolworth when the news came over the radio”. Instead, it’s told with vivid detail, metaphor, and cultural reference. For example: The “King” is an obvious reference to Elvis Presley, and the “Jester” is supposed to be Bob Dylan. These are just two examples, but if you look at the rest of the lyrics, the many interpretations are too many to count. However, don’t let the wordy, multi-faceted SIX verses shy you away; the whole sonic structure of the song is expertly crafted to evoke the catchy and exciting nostalgia of the late ‘50s rock and roll movement; all with a singable chorus that everyone can sing and ending with that line “This’ll be the day that I die…” leaves you wanting to hear what the next part of the story is. It’s more than just a fun, romp of a song, it’s a cultural experience. If I had to elect one song to represent Americana, this would be my pick. It perfectly encapsulates a hopeful and energetic optimism at a time when America was going through a rough patch, and all with somber lyrics about the death of some important artists, Ironically enough. I have to commend Don McLean for that, because it’s really hard to be happy when everything’s going oh so wrong.'

    title: El Paso
    artist: Marty Robbins
    year: '1960'
    genres:
      - Country
      - Tex-Mex
    commentary: 'Very rarely in the Hot 100 era of the Billboard Magazine did a country song reach #1. Before 1958, there were plenty of country/western songs that managed to reach #1 as the new Rock and Roll music was heavily influenced by country, blues, and folk, so there was plenty of overlap. However, by 1960, Doo-wop and R&B had pretty much taken over as the “pop” of the day, and the played-straight, country western had fallen to the wayside indefinitely. However, it was in the first week on the ‘60s decade that Marty Robbins managed to climb to #1 with this Tex-Mex single and was probably the last “real” country song to reach #1, as every other #1 hit to come after this one was influenced by other genres. Anyone who doesn’t listen to a lot of country (me, to my shame) may see the placement of this song so high on the list and scratch their heads. Maybe amongst dyed-in-the-wool country listeners, this seems like a no-brainer, but when you factor in every other genre from the ‘60s, this seems far from a legendary song from that decade, and to be honest I kinda agree. However, I HAD to rank it this high because it fails to raise ANY red flags. This song is basically the equivalent of an Olympic gymnast sticking a perfect-ten landing. It ticks all the boxes for a “perfect” song: Well-composed, well-mixed, well-written, well-structured, well-performed; not a single moment of this song is wasted; it’s all killer, no filler! Everything from Marty Robbins’ amazing vocal performance (along with those backing vocals), to the clever blending of each verse into the next, with the repeated motif of the “El paso” lyric at the beginning of every verse, the pleasant and unique Spanish guitar lines sprinkled throughout, and a super engaging story of a hopeless romantic fighting to the death for the love of a “dancer” in the wild west setting of El Paso, Texas; it really all comes together to make the closest we are getting to a “perfect” country song.'

    title: Gangsta's Paradise
    artist: Coolio feat. L.V.
    year: '1995'
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Gangsta rap
      - G-funk
    commentary: "Easily my favorite Hip hop #1 hit, maybe my favorite hip hop song ever honestly. I really do feel like the greatness of this song transcends tastes; I think if you put this song on, most people would like it regardless of what they listen to on a regular basis. Really, the main reason why I love this song so much is the story it tells. When it comes to storytelling in a song, Coolio really puts everyone else on this list to shame. This is a grim, tragic, and somber cautionary tale of life as a gang member. Coolio is no stranger to the mean streets of Compton, California; when he was a teen, he was a member of the “Baby Crips”, a youth shoot-off of the famous gang, which makes the lyrics feel like that of a sage. Case in point – the opening line referencing the Bible verse, Psalms 29: “As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I take a look at my life and realize there’s nothin’ left… ‘Cause I’ve been blastin’ and laughin’ so long, that even my mama thinks that my mind has gone”. This opening line really sets the mood for the whole song, and the rest of the lyrics are just as tragic. Lyrics like “I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc; as they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke…” and “Death ain’t nothin’ but a heartbeat away, I’m livin’ life do or die, what can I say? I’m 23 now, but will I live to see 24? The way things is goin’ I don’t know…” hammer home the fragility of the lifestyle, and Coolio sees himself as disposable; one step away from death. Another tragic theme is that of hopelessness. The lyrics “Look at the situation they got me facin’, I can’t live a normal life, I was raised by the street, so I gotta be down with the hood team… Too much television watchin’ got me chasin’ dreams…” show that he doesn’t see himself ever escaping this lifestyle; trapped in the game. The closing line on the final verse is the nail in the coffin: “They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me. If they can't understand it, how can they reach me? I guess they can't… I guess they won't… I guess they frontin'… that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!” Of course, the ultimate takeaway from the story is the bridge section, sung by L.V.: “Tell me why are we… so blind to see… that the ones we hurt… are you and me?” This is all without even mentioning the bumpin’ beat that supports the song, an interpolation of Stevie Wonder’s “Pastime Paradise”, which is just fantastic. The whole song has the iconic string section on repeat, and during the chorus we get that soaring, angelic choir that sings alongside L.V., who busts out an amazing vocal performance on the hook: “Been/keep spending most our lives livin’ in a gangsta’s paradise…” This one’s a crowning achievement for hip hop; really elevates the artform to much higher level. There will probably never be a song in the genre to transcend this one in heart and expression."

    title: Let's Get It On
    artist: Marvin Gaye
    year: '1973'
    genres:
      - Soul
      - R&B
    commentary: 'There is an interesting bit of irony with this song. The contrast between this song’s message and Marvin Gaye’s upbringing is immense… almost as if there was some kind of divine (or perhaps counter-divine?) destiny in the making of it: Marvin Gaye was raised by a father who was an ordained minister of a Pentecostal church, which is for the most part, a very evangelical sect of Christianity. At one point, Marvin even contemplated in following in his father’s footsteps in becoming a minster himself. However, he instead went on to be one the greatest soul artists of all-time, and went on to write this song, which is probably the most sexually liberating song to have ever been written to this day. It’s important to remember that in 1973, America was a lot more evangelical, and the explicit topic of sex in media was still too racy for most people. Hell, the “Hays Code” was still being followed in Hollywood up until 1968, just a mere four years before this song came out. Your average American would have probably rejected or outright protested a song like this, to this song’s credit, its message has outlasted its detractors. Contrary to what most spoof comedies and rom coms think this song is about: A song about unadulterated sex, it really is about liberation. Just look at these lyrics: “We’re all sensitive people with so much to give”, “…giving yourself to me can never be wrong, if the love is true”, “Don’t you know how sweet and wonderful life can be?”, “You don’t have to worry that it’s wrong”. This song isn’t about “getting it on”. It’s about destigmatizing sex and telling the listener that it’s OKAY to get it on. I mean, if ours is a society that stigmatizes the act, we might as well go all the way and stigmatize walking or eating. It’s preposterous that we needed a slow jam like this one to smarten us up. Speaking of, never has a song’s composition fit the theme of its lyrics as good as this one. The steady groove on the drums and bass with that “I-iii-IV-V” Chord progression evokes this feeling of positivity and hope. Sprinkle in some ad-libed wah guitar licks, a tasteful horn and string section, and some solid backing vocals; it really makes it hard to think bad thoughts while this song is playing. That without mentioning Gaye’s fantastic vocal performance. His range is immaculate, and his conviction is strong. It’s almost like he’s his father: a minister preaching to his followers about sexually liberating themselves from a world of prudes and fuddy duddys. Funny how things turned out for Gaye – he really did become a minister, but not in the way his father expected.'

    title: (Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay
    artist: Otis Redding
    year: '1968'
    genres:
      - Soul
      - R&B
    commentary: "I think we all have those moments of pure contemplation. Whenever we are doing menial tasks or driving home after work; we all have those moment of quiet peace where we rack our brains and just… think about stuff. Its moments like that where we develop the most as people, and it’s this song I think best captures that feeling more than any other. Otis Redding wrote the first verse while on a plane ride to Memphis and knowing he had a hit on his hands, called his good friend and fellow songwriter Steve Cropper immediately after he landed to tell him he’s was going to the studio THAT NIGHT to work on it. They both met there and hashed out the rest of the song. This simple song tells the story of Redding, who grew up in Georgia, moving all the way to San Francisco – from east coast to west coast. He’s worked so hard as an artist that he’s basically gotten everything he’s ever wanted, including a nice boathouse in the ‘Frisco bay… but he feels as if nothing has changed at all. He’s still his same old self, and now he’s just relaxing; sittin’ on the dock of the bay… contemplating. The songs starts us off with a softly strummed acoustic guitar, a warm bassline, and the sound of crashing waves; an intro that pulls us in with it’s calm demeanor, before going into the first verse sung by Redding: “Sittin' in the mornin' sun… I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come. Watching the ships roll in… and then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah…” The melancholic lyrics change the tone of the song from warm and fuzzy to borderline existential and uncertain. The whole song carries this tone throughout, while remaining catchy with the insatiable groove of Steve Cropper’s tasteful guitar licks. Even during the bridge section, which shifts gears for a moment to something a bit more hopeful sounding, it still remains melancholic and eventually comes back to its existential ponderance with the lyric “I can’t do what ten people tell me to do, so I guess I’ll remain the same…” The songs then fades us out after one last contemplative chorus with Redding doing some improv whistling, signifying that this tale remains unresolved. Indeed, this story would remain unresolved forever; just a mere two weeks later after recording the song, Redding would die in a plane crash on December 10, 1967. A combination of his death and the mass appeal of this hit song lead to his one and only #1 hit, and the first posthumous #1 hit in Billboard chart history. It’s a shame his life was cut so short, as this song was the beginning of a shift in his musical style that seemed to be much more honed and polished. Had he lived on, we may have had many-a soul hits that could have stood the test of time, but alas, those hits were never to be written."

    title: Georgia On My Mind
    artist: Ray Charles
    year: '1960'
    genres:
      - Soul
      - Traditional Pop
    commentary: 'You know, a lot of the songs that on this list are… well… good, at least in my opinion they are. However, most of these songs are either long forgotten in the grand scheme of things or are relics of their time. Some of them surpass that threshold and become classics to stand the test of time. However, very rarely does that “test of time” go beyond those that lived to hear it in its original context. Take for example the song “Don’t You (Forget about Me)” by Simple Minds. I would consider that a classic of the ‘80s, but a hundred years from now when everyone from that era of music is long gone, will it still be played? I mean, of course there will be people who listen to it, but will it still be a “staple” of our collective culture? Will it invoke the same feelings it did to those who heard it for the first time in 1985? Will people still associate it with the film “The Breakfast Club”? I don’t know, but there’s a good chance it won’t. Unfortunately, there is a limited amount of space we have in out collective minds to celebrate the past, which means we will have to pick and choose what’s worth remembering. It is with that being said, that out of all of the songs on this list, “Georgia On My Mind” is the only one that I think people will still celebrate long into the distant future. Assuming the United States is still around in the year of 2500, I can guarantee that people will still play it and celebrate it as not only a cultural piece representing Georgia, the state, but the United States as a whole. Originally written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell in 1930, it was made to be a nice blend of ragtime, jazz, and contemporary pop. It has a nice breezy swing to it, and an earnest vocal performance by Carmichael himself. It’s a good song all on its own, but Ray Charles’ interpretation elevates it into beyond legendary status. This song was made to be slowed down and soul-ified, and Ray Charles knocked it out of the park. Actually, scratch that – he knocked it out of orbit. The soft string intro gives way to the heartfelt vocals of Charles: “Georgia… Georgia… The whole day through… just an old sweet song… keeps Georgia on my mind.” You can tell that this song meant a whole lot to him. He was born and raised in Georgia, so it would make sense that he would put his heart and soul into it. However, it’s the refrain of this song that just breaks me down. “Other arms a-reach out to me… other eyes smile tenderly… still in peaceful dreams I see… the road leads back to you.” This is how I interpret it: Charles had an unfortunate upbringing; in that he had gone blind by age 7 due to glaucoma. By that time, he still hadn’t left his home state of Georgia which means his only frame of reference, visually speaking, would have been his home of Georgia. However, something tells me that at night when he dreamt, that he could see clear as day, and that maybe for just a fleeting moment… he could see his home once again with clear and open eyes. That hits hard for me. Ray Charles’ performance of this song was so good that in a mere 19 years, the State of Georgia had made it their state song in 1979. That’s the power this song has. Many other states adopted songs from many a decade removed from its inauguration and were mostly comprised of old band numbers and songs from folklore, which makes sense. They needed to pick something that was not only representative of their state. but had enough cultural significance to be recognizable long into the distant future. 19 years… that’s all it took for Ray Charles’ version of “Georgia On My Mind” to reach that milestone.'

    title: Bridge Over Troubled Water
    artist: Simon & Garfunkel
    year: '1970'
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Gospel
    commentary: |-
      Dedicated to Nancy Horton Robards… my biggest fan.

      “Perfect” Is one of those words that a critic should almost always avoid. Besides, how can something as subjective as music be perfect? After all, what’s perfect for one person may be a train wreck to another. However, I think my use of the word “perfect” is one that is very universal and optimistic. The “perfect” song is one that your grandfather would play on the piano to cheer you up when you were having a bad day. The “perfect” song is the one that your cool bus driver from 1st grade would play on his cassette player on your way to school every morning and get you to sing along to. The “perfect” song is one that helped you out of a dark place during a low point in your life. The “perfect” song is one that your lover, your soulmate, shares with you; to celebrate the time you’ve spent together on this green earth. The “perfect” song is the one that your friend from high school would mockingly sing to you to embarrass you in front of your crush. The “perfect” song is the one that you sang at the top of your lungs with your brothers and sisters on that one road trip to Florida all those years ago. In other words, the “perfect” song is the one that matters the most to you in those moments of your life… when you needed them the most. I can’t say that “Bridge Over Troubled Water” by Simon & Garfunkel has ever been that song to me, but I’d like to imagine that to many people, it has been.

      Of course, me being a big music nerd, I can’t help but claim that, by some objective measure, this is the closest I’ve ever been to thinking a song is just outright “perfect”. Not just as a pop song, or a folk song, or a gospel song, or even as a #1 hit… but as a song in of itself. I think it’s a safe bet to say that this is probably the greatest song of the 20th century. Never has a song carried with it the emotion, power, technicality, precision, heart, and soul as much as this this one. Listening to it is like a transcendent experience… every time I listen to it. This is a song that, after hearing it for the second time ever in my entire life (Yeah, I don’t know how this song eluded me for 26 years), brought me to tears. It was at that moment that I knew this was going to be my favorite #1 hit, and that no song from the following years could ever surpass it in any way, and none ever did.

      It’s actually very similar to another song that I personally think is the greatest song of the 19th century, “Clair De Lune” by Claude DeBussy, in that it is a piano suite. The song originally was written by Paul Simon on guitar in early 1969 after listening to the song “Mary Don’t You Weep” by the gospel group, The Swan Silvertones. The song contained the line “I’ll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in my name”. According to Simon, it just “came to him very quickly.” He also pulled inspiration for the melody from an old Christian hymn, composed by Bach called “O Sacred Head, Now Wounded”. However, at some point, he decided to transcribe it to piano with session musician Larry Knechtel to fit the gospel nature of the song, and before he knew it, he had a piano ballad on his hands. After recording a quick demo, he then presented it to arranger Ernie Freeman, to include a string arrangement, done by the famous “Wrecking Crew”, a group of prolific session musicians of the era, to make the song even more gospely and angelic. The end result was this:
      The song starts us off with a flooring series of piano chords, expertly played by Larry Knechtel. At first, it sounds quite somber but then it softly rises back up to a major key and establishes the progression leading into the first verse, sung by Art Garfunkel: “When you’re weary, feeling small… When tears are in your eyes… I’ll dry them all.” Paul and Art had a bit of a turbulent relationship when it came to music, and there’s supposedly a rumor that when asked why Paul keep Art around, he said with sincerely something along the lines of: “…because he has the voice that I hear in my head when I write the songs.” Let’s not mince words here: this IS Art’s song – this song was made for his voice, and no other person can ever match it. Many artists would cover this song, but NO ONE can sing it like Art can. This is easily his best vocal performance, and the best vocal performance in pop history, hands down. Never has a voice been so soft, smooth, fragile, and vulnerable. This is a song about friendship. About being there for someone when they are having a rough time. It’s a song of reassurance that no matter what, we will be there to help them through and be their shining light, even in darkness… to be their bridge over troubled water. “I’m on your side, oh, when times get rough… and friends just can’t be found… Like a bridge over troubled water… I will lay me down.” The last line being of course taken from the classic children’s bedtime prayer, which suits the gospel nature of the song perfectly.

      It’s during the second chorus when Art goes from a soft and vulnerable voice, to a high-noted, pained vibrato. I like to think this signifies the moment when Art takes on the pain of his friend, as to keep them from getting hurt and to shield them from all that aims to hurt them. This is also when we get the subtle and delicate introduction of the bass and some light percussion. Which gives us a reprieve from the pain and a moment of rest and reflection. However, its right after that the strings sneak in, with Simon providing backing vocals and it’s just… absolutely angelic: “Sail on silver girl… sail on by…. your time has come to shine… all your dreams are on their way.” It’s at this point that the song’s lyrics shift towards what appears to be a lover of some kind; the support goes from taking on someone else’s pain to providing moral support for a loved one… to push them towards their dreams and help them in their endeavors. “See how they shine, oh, if you need a friend… I’m sailing right behind… like a bridge over troubled water… I will ease your mind.” The song launches into a massive crescendo with Art belting out an impressively high note, and with what appears to be the sound of a cannon shot, the song is then is closed by the string arrangement… holding onto a high, sustained note.

      Not. One. Second… Of this song is wasted. Every possible opportunity to make each second count, to make the composition perfect, was taken. Simon & Garfunkel would go on to win 5 Grammy’s at the 1971 awards ceremony, including “Song of the Year” and “Best Arrangement, Instrumental & Vocals”. A very much well-deserved award, that last one.

      …and that’s it, folks! My favorite song to reach #1 in the U.S! It only took listening to over 1,100 songs, but we came out clean on the other side! For everyone that has been reading these posts and liking and commenting, thank you so much for the support. I never thought I’d ever reach the end of this project, but I’m glad I did. It was fun listening to all this music – I definitely will be “borrowing” some ideas from what I heard and utilizing them into my playing when I pick up my guitar, that’s for sure. I’ll also be mixing a good chunk of these songs into my future playlists; and maybe I’ll use some of them as an excuse to expand my listening into new territories and discover some new stuff!
      I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… there really isn’t any “bad” music from the past or present. Every year had its ups, it’s downs, and plenty of middling songs that’s for sure, but ultimately, if you open your mind a bit and listen closely, you’ll always find good music at any period. For anyone who grew up during a certain period of the Hot 100’s history or are around my age and listen to the newest stuff, I implore you to check out the decades you missed out on and get curious with your tastes. I know I did, and look at me now; I got so much stuff sitting in my backlog now… I may have to start reviewing some of it! Who knows…?

      Once again, thank you all for the support!
