commentary: |
  By September 1984, the lower rungs of the extended chart were stacked with left-field discoveries. College radio
  staples from The Smiths sat alongside freestyle experiments, giving crate-diggers plenty to explore. This companion
  piece to the [Top 220 Neon Nights recap](/rankings/top-220-neon-nights-1984-08-04/) shows how quickly trends shifted
  after the summer rush.
