    title: Low
    artist: Flo Rida feat. T-Pain
    year: "2008"
    genres:
      - Southern hip hop
      - Crunk
    commentary: Ah yes, the “Apple bottom jeans” song! Our first entry on the list, and it’s the only Crunk song to be included on this list. I must admit that despite being in a genre I don’t like, this song is in fact, a banger. That’s mainly due to the energy that T-Pain brings to this song during the chorus. The hook is infectiously catchy, and I can’t help but go “Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low…” on that last line of the chorus every time it comes up. Oh yeah, and Flo Rida raps pretty good on this one as well.

    title: Live Your Life
    artist: T.I. feat. Rihanna
    year: "2008"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - R&B
    commentary: Much like “Low”, this one was included on the list for it’s main hook “So just live your life, Aye! Ayyyyyyye!” Another reason is the fact that T.I. and Rihanna built the whole song around an interpolation of the melody of “Dragostea Din Tei” by Moldovan Eurodance group O-Zone. Better known by us red-blooded Americans as the “Numa Numa song”. I mean, I have no clue as to why they thought that was a good idea, but by-Jove, they friggin’ made it work. Also, it’s worth mentioning the lyrics are pretty good too; singing about making the best of what you got and to “just live your life”. Very optimistic for a hip hop song, that’s for sure.
  - position: 218
    title: SexyBack
    artist: Justin Timberlake
    year: "2006"
    genres:
      - Electro-R&B
      - Dance-pop
      - Hip hop
    commentary: I was contemplating putting this one higher up but decided to keep it around this part of the list. I can’t say much else either than that it’s one hell of an earworm dance track. It’s clearly a tongue-in-cheek song with the “take it to the fridge/chorus!” backing line. Also, that “go ‘head be gone wit’ it” refrain is hella catchy to listen to. I think its greatest quality is that it’s quite minimal in its composition. It’s a testament to how good of a writer you are if you can write a dance club track with just a simple looped beat and some keys.
  - position: 217
    title: Firework
    artist: Katy Perry
    year: 2010/11
    genres:
      - Dance-pop
    commentary: I can’t say that this song has anything particular unique with it’s production, as it sounds like every over-produced pop track of the early ‘10s. However, there are two things that make this song great. It’s the clever and inspiration lyrics combined with a fantastic vocal performance by Perry. The way she builds up to that chorus is just great; it really sends this song into the stratosphere and suits the lyrical message very well. I mean, it’s as if her voice is like a firework climbing up into the sky before bursting!
  - position: 216
    title: Smooth
    artist: Santana feat. Rob Thomas
    year: 1999/00
    genres:
      - Latin rock
      - Alternative rock
    commentary: In the last ‘90s and early ‘00s, Latin pop exploded into the U.S. mainstream. I can’t say I liked any of the attempts by the likes of Jennifer Lopez or Ricky Martin, but If I had to pick a song from this era to put on this list, it’s gotta be this song, hands down. Santana’s guitar work on this song is absolutely virtuosic, and despite featuring white boy Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty fame on the track for vocals, his “smooth” vocals are very good, and the chorus is very singable as well.
  - position: 215
    title: Willow
    artist: Taylor Swift
    year: "2020"
    genres:
      - Chamber folk
    commentary: "This is the most recent #1 to be featured on this list, having been released in December of 2020. Last year, Taylor Swift decided to “shake off” her plasticky pop aesthetic, return to her roots as an ambitious teenager country singer and write some acoustic folk tunes. Of the two songs from this phase in here music career to reach #1, I picked Willow because I just think it’s the most well-composed and is very relaxing to listen to. It’s also got a very charming chorus; it’s like a warm fireplace on a cold winter’s day."
  - position: 214
    title: Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)
    artist: C+C Music Factory feat. Freedom Williams
    year: "1991"
    genres:
      - Dance-pop
      - Hip house
    commentary: Easily my favorite dance club track of the ‘90s, it combined the best of the ‘90s club scene and rock music. That main electric rock guitar riff is just bad ass to listen to, it’s the closest you’d ever get to a “metal” club track, I think. Not to mention the soaring vocal performance of Freedom Williams, she really gives it her all on this one, and gives the song soooo much more energy than it has a right to.
  - position: 213
    title: Dominique
    artist: The Singing Nun
    year: "1963"
    genres:
      - Folk
      - Religious
    commentary: "The only song sung in French to reach #1, this cutesy folk song was written by Sister Jeanne-Paule Marie of the Belgian Dominican Order, and was featured in the film of the same name, sung in English by actress Debbie Reynolds. The song is about a humble dude traveling the world to spread the word of God; a standard affair for Sunday school, but I put this on the list due to the fact that it reached #1 in a year with some of the most crass and generic doo-wop pop songs to ever come out. Sometimes, it’s cool seeing some raw talent shining through the clouds… also the song is very catchy."
  - position: 212
    title: Fingertips Pt. 2
    artist: Little Stevie Wonder
    year: "1963"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Soul
    commentary: This one’s the B-side of a live performance of “Little” Stevie Wonder at the Regal Theater in Chicago, 1963. It’s a bit jarring to listen to, since it hard-cuts into song about halfway and the recording quality is quite atrocious, but what makes this a great song is the fact that a 12-year old Stevie Wonder is carrying the whole damn performance with his Harmonica and Bongos. It’s like a sneak-peek into his greatness, and a taste of what was about to come in the ‘70s. Oh yeah, it also features a young Marvin Gaye on the drums, which is neat.
  - position: 211
    title: Drop It Like It's Hot
    artist: Snoop Dogg feat. Pharrell Williams
    year: "2004"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
    commentary: The meanest and baddest Snoop’s every sounded, this minimal hip hop track is almost entirely constructed from a simple drum machine loop, a spray paint can, and some tongue clicks. It’s almost absurd to listen to, but Snoop pulls it off and manages to have such a commanding presence over the whole song, with lyrics about Crip gang activity and kidnapping. It seems a bit weird to listen to Pharrell Williams rap about knowing “killers in the streets” in retrospect, but you also have to remember that he was part of the rap-group N.E.R.D., and they sure as hell weren’t writing songs like “Happy”.
  - position: 210
    title: 9 to 5
    artist: Dolly Parton
    year: "1981"
    genres:
      - Country
    commentary: One of the greatest country crossover hits of all-time, Parton brought a funky twist to what would otherwise be a standard country number. However, that’s all it took to make this song one of the catchiest tunes about the daily grind. If you go on the YouTube video for this song and look at the comment section, you’ll see tons of people claimed to not like country music at all, but gush about how much they love this song. I think it has to do with the fact that it’s extremely relatable for so many people and it’s just a flat-out funky song. Also, some of the percussion was literally done by Parton’s long nails.
  - position: 209
    title: Never Gonna Give You Up
    artist: Rick Astley
    year: "1988"
    genres:
      - Dance-pop
      - Blue-eyed soul
    commentary: It’s the Rickroll song everybody! You’ve probably have been bamboozled at least once by someone sending you a benign link, only for it to lead to this song’s music video on Youtube. However, despite the novelty of this meme song, it’s just a great dance-track on its own, and Astley’s voice is buttery smooth throughout. It kinda blows my mind that such a skinny white dude from England can have such a deep voice, but then again I listen to Beck, and he’s pretty much the same thing, only he’s an American folk artist. Sometimes, all the wires cross in the right place, and we get a stellar track like this one outta nowhere. I’m not complaining!
  - position: 208
    title: (I Can't Help) Falling In Love
    artist: UB40
    year: "1993"
    genres:
      - Reggae fusion
      - Dance-pop
    commentary: Although I enjoy listening to the original by Elvis Presley more, this was the right cover to come out at the right time. UB-40 takes the slow serenade and turns it into an upbeat dance track, and it works so well here. When it comes to covers, what I think makes a good one is when an artist takes the original and puts their own spin on it to make it their own, and I think these guys achieved that here. I can’t say it’s an adequate replacement to the original, but it’s definitely a welcome addition.
  - position: 207
    title: We Found Love
    artist: Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris
    year: 2011/12
    genres:
      - Electro house
    commentary: Another club track, this one’s got an extremely catchy keyboard riff that drives the song. I think what makes it great is how it changes up every time you hear it, which adds a much-needed depth to a song that wouldn’t have it otherwise. It’s also got some great vocals by Rihanna; it was a great idea to feature her on this song. The song has also got an honest-to-God bass drop with a proper lead-up, meaning this is probably the closest dubstep has ever gotten to the top of the charts.
  - position: 206
    title: Don't Matter
    artist: Akon
    year: "2007"
    genres:
      - Reggae fusion
      - R&B
    commentary: This one’s a nice, little laid-back Reggae R&B song; includes an interpolation of the Bob Marley song “Zimbabwe” during the chorus. Besides the immaculate production quality, Akon’s vocal performance is just fantastic. His nasally voice, intentional or not, adds a sincere and vulnerable quality to the song which suits the lyrics very well. “Nobody want to see us together, but it don’t matter, no. ‘cause I got you babe.” It’s just a catchy and pleasant song to listen to.
  - position: 205
    title: Hey There Delilah
    artist: Plain White T's
    year: "2007"
    genres:
      - Folk pop
      - Emo pop
    commentary: "The mid to late ‘00s was the golden age of Emo music; and the one and only #1 hit song of this genre turned out to be a simple and sincere acoustic ballad. The chord progression is very somber and emotional, on top of the lyrics about unconditional love. I can see why this had such a mainstream appeal; sometimes if you pour your heart out in the studio, you can make the one song to define the generation of young, bratty, and emotional teenagers (okay that’s a bit of hyperbole, but you get my point)."
  - position: 204
    title: Runaround Sue
    artist: Dion
    year: "1961"
    genres:
      - Doo-wop
      - Rock and roll
    commentary: The one and only doo-wop song on this list; what sets this song apart from the rest of the pack is the fantastic vocal performance by Dion. His voice, unlike a lot of the other dawdling whimpering singers of this time, has an actual power behind it. I also love how simple the song is. The rhythm section has plenty going on, but the main driving force behind the song is the 4/4 time clapping. This is one of those songs that would make for great A Cappella.
  - position: 203
    title: Big Girls Don't Cry (Personal)
    artist: Fergie
    year: "2007"
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: It seems a bit weird seeing Fergie sing a sad pop ballad, consider her wheelhouse is being a “bad bitch” and writing songs about “my hump” and how she’s got that “boom boom pow”, but honestly, this is her at her best. The acoustic-guitar-driven verse sections with her soft, vulnerable voice makes way for the powerful chorus sections where she belts out the lyrics about how “this has nothing to do with you; It’s personal, myself and I” It’s cool seeing a love/break-up song about self-reflection and improvement when typically, songs like this have a more mopey “wah wah” vibe to them.
  - position: 202
    title: Pop Muzik
    artist: M
    year: "1979"
    genres:
      - New wave
      - Synth-pop
      - Disco
    commentary: At the time of its popularity, this may have seemed like a throwaway novelty song to listeners, but little did they know they were peering into the future of what “pop music” was going to sound like. I gotta give credit to the project creator of M, Robin Scott, for creating this hit, as it’s not only a sample of what the ‘80s were going to sound like, but also a homage to all of the pop music that came before. It takes the auditory traits of the ‘50s, ‘60s, and ‘70s, and combines them with a fresh new sound. If you haven’t heard the song, I implore you to check it out and try and find the callbacks to the previous decades of pop music, it’s a fun time for sure.
  - position: 201
    title: Bad Blood
    artist: Taylor Swift feat. Kendrick Lamar
    year: "2015"
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Hip hop
    commentary: The “tough” era of Taylor Swift; a little cringy seeing this trust-fund baby try and act like some dominatrix assassin, but at least when it comes to the music, she pulls it off well. The low-bass industrial mix of the song suits the tough aesthetic, and besides the catchy chorus, we’ve got Kendrick Lamar going hard on the verses; overall, I’d call this one a “sleeper hit” badass song by Swift.
  - position: 200
    title: Set Fire to the Rain
    artist: Adele
    year: "2012"
    genres:
      - Soul
      - Pop
      - R&B
    commentary: "A solid piano ballad by Adele; unlike her other #1 hits, this one’s a bit more upbeat and determined in its composition. It’s funny to think that this is Adele’s most complicated song to hit #1, since there’s basically a standard band backing her vocals. With that being said, Adele gives us a fantastic vocal performance as always. A pleasant song to listen to with a great outro to boot."
  - position: 199
    title: Happy
    artist: Pharrell Williams
    year: "2014"
    genres:
      - Soul
      - Neo-soul
    commentary: A soulful anthem of joy and groove! Pharrell’s got one hell of a knack for bouncing around genres, and this has got to be his best solo performance out of all of them. An upbeat soul song with a solid rhythm section and some very singable lyrics makes this song what it is. My favorite part of the song has got to be the breakdown in the middle and towards the end of the song. It’s infectiously catchy, all thanks to the clap-rhythm holding the groove as well as some solid backup vocals to change the tone of the song. If we every get through this pandemic, this has got to be the song that plays!
  - position: 198
    title: Tha Crossroads
    artist: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
    year: "1996"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - R&B
    commentary: "I originally didn’t like this song, mainly because the beat and production of this track sounded really dated but decided to include it on the list for two reasons: one, the flows by all of the members are insanely good; like super-fast but rhythmically appropriate, and two the lyrics are actually very good. There’s these biblical overtones over the whole song with the main theme being remembering and celebrating the lives of those who passed on, citing personal family members as well as other rappers who died from AIDs or gang-related activity. The main hook of “see you at tha crossroads…” is chilling to listen to when you understand what the song is about."
  - position: 197
    title: Black Water
    artist: The Doobie Brothers
    year: "1975"
    genres:
      - Roots rock
      - Country rock
      - Southern rock
      - Bluegrass
    commentary: "The only bluegrass-ish(?) song to ever reach #1, and a damn good one! The Doobie Brothers do a fantastic job of combining that down-home bluegrass vibe with an insatiable funk groove. The way the fiddles, drums, and guitar lock into that groove is just great and the “I’d like to hear some funky Dixieland, Pretty mama come take me by the hand” Is a fantastic lyric that plays into the song so well; a testament to the talent of the group, for sure!"
  - position: 196
    title: Just Give Me a Reason
    artist: Pink feat. Nate Ruess
    year: "2013"
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: Coming off the success of “We Are Young”, Nate Ruess of indie-pop band “fun.” teams up with Pink to perform this duet ballad... and man, did they strike gold with this one. Both of their voices were made for each other and it’s a shame they never had any other duets or hit singles. I think that if they would form a group together, they’d tear up the charts, for sure. As for the song itself, the primal drum beat combined with those somber yet hopeful piano chords make for great composition and the chorus has an amazing “high-flying” feel to it that suits the song very well.
  - position: 195
    title: Love Yourself
    artist: Justin Bieber
    year: "2016"
    genres:
      - Acoustic Pop
    commentary: An unsuspecting hit by Bieber, this one consists of a single clean-guitar riff and Bieber’s voice for most of the song; that’s all it took to make probably the sincerest song Bieber has ever done. Despite being a bit out of his wheelhouse, he knocks it out of the park here and the little trumpet break in the middle is the icing on the cake.
  - position: 194
    title: All of Me
    artist: John Legend
    year: "2014"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Soul
      - Pop
    commentary: "A fantastic piano ballad played in a minor-key, which is typically not what reaches #1. Major key aka “happy” sounding songs typically top the charts, but it’s always nice to see some folks get there going the other direction musically. Legend’s voice on top of those somber chords adds a weight to the song that can’t be matched and the lyrical content of giving yourself to someone and loving them unconditionally are just tailor-made for a song of this nature; fantastic composition and performance."
  - position: 193
    title: Savage
    artist: Megan Thee Stallion feat. Beyoncé
    year: "2020"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - R&B
    commentary: The ultimate “bad bitch” anthem. The hypnotic beat combined with those hard-as-nail lyrics makes for a real banger. Don’t be fooled… Megan does these lyrics justice with a commanding performance. “I’m a Savage. Classy. Bougee. Ratchet… Sassy. Moody. Nasty. Actin’ stupid, what’s happ’nin’? Bitch, what’s happ’nin’?” Sprinkle in Beyoncé ad-libs and baritone vocal performance and you have a song to represent every “bad bitch” for many years to come.
  - position: 192
    title: I Love Rock N' Roll
    artist: Joan Jett & The Blackhearts
    year: "1982"
    genres:
      - Hard rock
    commentary: "I mean, how can you hate this song? It’s the ultimate rock anthem to end all rock anthems! People think this was originally done by Joan Jett, but it’s actually a cover of a 1975 song by the rock band Arrows. However, that doesn’t take away from the bluesy, distorted guitar riffs and catchy chorus that Joan Jett does justice to this song with. Lesson for any young rockers out there: If you can write a simple, straight-forward rock number with easy-to-remember lyrics, you’ll be a breakout success in no time! (Okay, I can’t guarantee that in any shape or form but good luck anyway)."
  - position: 191
    title: Me and Mrs. Jones
    artist: Billy Paula
    year: "1972"
    genres:
      - Soul
    commentary: An extremely soulful and intimate song; you’d think it was about a wife or a lover, but it’s actually about a mistress! That’s right, this man is pouring his soul out about a women he sees at “6:30 at the same café” and they “have to be extra careful to not gets their hopes up too high”; it’s actually quite a charming song when you listen to it. Maybe a bit morally ambiguous in its message but still an absolute banger of a soul track; the kind that melts you into a puddle with its smoothness.
  - position: 190
    title: Just Dance
    artist: Lady Gaga feat. Colby O'Donis
    year: "2009"
    genres:
      - Electro-pop
      - Synth-pop
      - Dance-pop
    commentary: "The song that effectively put Lady Gaga on the map, this was her hail-marry attempt at breaking through to the masses, and it worked. The song was mostly written and composed by Gaga, and she wears her electronic/dance club music on her sleeve on this one. Solid synth hooks, a catchy chorus, and one of the best breakdowns of the 2010s: A descending key riff and that “Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, it’s symphonic” lyric is just genius."
  - position: 189
    title: The Battle of New Orleans
    artist: Johnny Horton
    year: "1959"
    genres:
      - Country
    commentary: I always love a good story, and Johnny Horton is a good storyteller! This song’s about the famous battle at the end of the War of 1812, and not only is it informative, but it’s extremely catchy and funny too! This was the kind of thing I wanted my cadets to march to, but figured it had too many moving parts for them to pull off in just a semester amongst college classes and PT in the mornings.
  - position: 188
    title: Thank God I'm a Country Boy
    artist: John Denver
    year: "1975"
    genres:
      - Country folk
    commentary: I wish I could say a whole lot about this song, but I just can’t. It’s pretty much a fantastically well-written and composed country song that’s extremely catchy, upbeat, and a great representative to those who great up out in the country! I can’t truly say that I grew up a country boy, but with a song like this, it kinda makes me wish I did!
  - position: 187
    title: Gold Digger
    artist: Kayne West feat. Jamie Foxx
    year: "2005"
    genres:
      - Hip-hop
    commentary: "A gold nugget in a year of lame-ass #1 hits, this hip hop number is the epitome of not giving AF. The whole song is one-big braggadocious rant about how “yeah, she may be a gold digger, but I still love her anyway”. West’s commanding presence over the song with some genuinely funny lyrics are what make this song great; the choice to build the whole song around an interpolation of Ray Charles’ “I Got A Women” was also a great idea; set’s it apart from a lot the “Crunk” of this era."
  - position: 186
    title: Abracadabra
    artist: Steve Miller Band
    year: "1982"
    genres:
      - Pop rock
      - Electronic rock
      - Funk rock
      - New wave
    commentary: This one’s a bit of a soft spot for me, as I had already really liked this song before the project. The whole song has this mystic, gypsy feel to it which suits the song very well, and the refrain “Abra, abracadabra… I wanna reach out and grab ya” is very catchy. My favorite thing about this song is its guitar solo. Easily one of the most underrated solos of all-time, we got Miller sliding up and down the neck on a heavily reverberated guitar, amplifying the mystic feel to the song and ending it with a fantastic descending riff as icing on the cake.
  - position: 185
    title: No Scrubs
    artist: TLC
    year: "1999"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Hip-pop
    commentary: A song directed towards the “scrubs” of the world; TLC is calling out every weirdo male fan that has ever hit on them. Although, it may be a bit dated now. As I mention before, if you won’t date a guy because he doesn’t have a place of his own, then you are massively shrinking the dating pool. In today’s economy, you’d be hard-pressed to find any young and upcoming homeowners. Hell, even people who rent are probably dirt-poor, so that shrinks the pool even more. I guess in the late ‘90s the economy was good enough that even some punk-ass 20-something could afford rent, but in our post-recession world, that’s a fat chance. Besides the funny lyrics, the rhythm section with that tight snare and triangle driving the song is fantastic, and of course, TLC’s ability to harmonize is to be not questioned here.
  - position: 184
    title: The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face
    artist: Roberta Flack
    year: "1972"
    genres:
      - Soul
      - Vocal jazz
    commentary: I had never heard this song before a few months ago; the only thing I knew was that It had won a Grammy, and that was about it. However, after hearing it, I can safely say that this is a great song. Sometimes all you need is a soft and simple instrumentation to tell a story, and Flack’s voice is absolutely amazing on this jazzy, humble love song; easily one of the best easy-listening pop songs every written.
  - position: 183
    title: Cathy's Clown
    artist: The Everly Brothers
    year: "1960"
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: Another song during the doo-wop era, this one’s unique in that it’s more of a proto-Simon & Garfunkel song instead of a standard doo-wop number. Heck, the chord progression isn’t even doo-wop! The harmonization between the two brothers is absolutely amazing and the staggered rhythm really makes it stand out in a sea of early ‘60s bubblegum pop. A real songwriter’s song if you know what I mean!
  - position: 182
    title: Everything You Want
    artist: Vertical Horizon
    year: "2000"
    genres:
      - Alternative rock
      - Post-grunge
    commentary: "The only modern rock song to be featured on this list; in the early ‘00s, all of-a-sudden pop listeners started listening to the “post-grunge” rock of this era. Several rock artists found themselves on top of the charts during this short period of time, such as Creed, Nickleback, and Matchbox Twenty. However, I think Vertical Horizon’s #1 hit song is the better one of the bunch. This song has this hypnotic fade-in/fade-out guitar riff that I just can’t get enough of, as well as some fantastic acoustic guitar work. It’s also got some neat lyrics about loving someone who doesn’t love you back, and it’s not just some sappy “boo-hoo” lyrics, but clever ones. It probably helps that everyone in the band are college graduates, so they should have some decent writing skills anyway."

    title: California Gurls
    artist: Katy Perry feat. Snoop Dogg
    year: "2010"
    genres:
      - Disco-pop
      - Funk-pop
    commentary: A sort of re-imagining of the Beach Boys song of similar name, this 2010’s dance-pop tune is just fantastic. Besides the top-notch production quality of the track, it’s got some very tasteful callbacks to ‘90s West-Coast Hip Hop. Most likely to pay homage to the feature on this track, Snoop Dogg (who’s performance is also pretty good as well). The chorus is easily the best part of the song, being infectiously catchy and a bit seductive in its lyrical content. Either way, I think Katy Perry does a great job with the modern update of the Beach Boys song, and will probably be more fondly remembered than the original, I bet.

    title: Hypnotize
    artist: The Notorious B.I.G.
    year: "1997"
    genres:
      - Gangsta rap
      - Mafioso rap
      - Hardcore hip hop
    commentary: "Just a badass song; This is primarily a funk bass-driven song with an interpolation of the guitar break from Herp Alpert’s former #1 hit song “Rise”. It’s your typical affair for a braggadocious rap song, but Biggie Smalls’ performance combined with the insatiable funk of the song is what makes this the perfect “walking out into the ring” song for me. It’s a damn shame he was murdered before he could see the success of this song."

    title: If You Don't Know Me by Now
    artist: Simply Red
    year: "1989"
    genres:
      - Blue-eyed soul
      - Jazz
    commentary: I’m partial to this cover of the 1972 Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song, but It’s still a faithful cover through and through. The vocal performance by lead singer Mick Hucknall is just so tasteful and matches the tone of the original so well, that I just had to include it onto the list; a welcome addition.

    title: A Big Hunk o' Love
    artist: Elvis Presley
    year: "1959"
    genres:
      - Rock and roll
    commentary: "A short little boogie-woogie number by the King himself; I definitely would have included one his earlier hits, but since this project starts at 1958, this would be his only #1 hit of the classic Elvis era to make the list. However, don’t take that to mean this is a lesser song of his. This one rocks hard, and Elvis brings a grit to the song that is unmatched. Also let’s not ignore the banger piano solo by Floyd Cramer, one of the best solos to hit #1."
  - position: 177
    title: How Will I Know
    artist: Whitney Houston
    year: "1986"
    genres:
      - Synth-funk
      - Dance-pop
      - R&B
    commentary: Houston in the ‘80s was the go-to synthpop/dance artist. She (or at least her producers) were great at combining the catchy earworm nature of synthpop and the best qualities of R&B. I think this song in particular is their crowning achievement. The upbeat, jovial nature of the song and Houston’s powerful vocal performance are what make this a great song. The chorus is sure to make you want to bust a move.

    title: Dancing Queen
    artist: ABBA
    year: "1977"
    genres:
      - Disco
      - Europop
    commentary: "I think this is probably the best disco song to ever reach #1. ABBA may have been just another disco act, but I think what made them stand out amongst the rest of the acts were their uncanny ability to makes their songs sound bigger and more epic than your standard disco number. This operatic masterpiece is their magnum opus, for sure."

    title: Sad!
    artist: XXXTentacion
    year: "2018"
    genres:
      - Cloud rap
      - Alternative R&B
      - Emo rap
    commentary: The only Soundcloud rap song to be featured on this list, and I think it’s a good one. X’s performance is vulnerable and desperate, which matches the sad, suicidal vibe of the song very well. The floaty, reverberated beat of the song is also something that helps a lot with matching this vibe. I can’t say I liked X as a person, as he was quite a violent and aggressive, but even then, it’s a shame he was murdered. He was still very young and had the potential to grow as an artist and as a person, but he never got the chance to do that.

    title: The Long and Winding Road / For You Blue
    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1970"
    genres:
      - Rock/Country blues
    commentary: "A double single by the Fab Four and their final to hit #1. Did you know they had TWENTY #1 hits? It’s insane just how popular they were, even in the later years when they decided to get more experimental. The first song off of this single “The Long and Winding Road”, however, is far from that. Instead, it’s the personification of “Riding out into the sunset”. I’m not kidding, this song sounds like the final song to play at the end of a long saga. A nice, pleasant, symphonic soft rock number to close off this chapter of rock history. As for “For You Blue”, it’s a bluesy and gritty welcome addition to George Harrison’s discography. Even when he was going through the spiritual phase of his life, he could still pump out a banger of a blue rock number."

    title: Venus
    artist: Bananarama
    year: "1986"
    genres:
      - Dance-pop
      - Hi-NRG
    commentary: A fantastic cover; Usually I’d like the original better, but this song was made to be an upbeat dance number. The girls over at Bananrama knew that, and approached producer Stock Aiken Waterman with the idea, and they immediately got to work on it. They knew they had a hit on their hands, and they knocked it right out of the park. Immaculate synths and slinky guitars; it’s just so good!

    title: Sunflower
    artist: Post Malone & Swae Lee
    year: "2019"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Dream pop
      - R&B
    commentary: "An interesting #1 hit, both Post Malone and Swae Lee are by no means are family-friendly artists, but they managed to make one the best all-ages hit of 2010s. Mainly written by Post Malone, this dreamy pop song is extremely pleasant on the ears and gives the listener a warm feeling of security. The staggered drum loop, the heavily reverberated vocals, the rumbly bass, the ethereal guitar licks; it’s very much a “greater than the sum of it’s parts” song. This is contemporary hit that I think even the most fuddy-duddy persons can enjoy."
  - position: 171
    title: Just The Way You Are
    artist: Bruno Mars
    year: "2010"
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Soft Rock
      - R&B
    commentary: Another unconditional love song, but this one’s special. Unlike most songs of this nature, it’s not a slow piano ballad, but instead an upbeat funk song. However, it still manages to have that vulnerable and sincere vibe to it, thanks to Mars’ vocal performance and that keyboard progression.

    title: Old Town Road
    artist: Lil' Nas X feat. Billy Ray Cyrus
    year: "2019"
    genres:
      - Country rap
      - Trap
      - Pop
      - Southern hip hop
    commentary: "The biggest #1 hit of all-time with an impressive and record-breaking 19 consecutive weeks at #1, you’d expect it to be one hell of an earworm… and you’d be right. This tightly produced trap rap song was written by Lil’ Nas X with the beat being an interpolation of the Nine Inch Nails song “34 Ghosts IV”. Maybe that’s why I like it so much, or maybe it’s because of how silly the song is. The lyrics are tongue-in-cheek as hell, but in a tasteful way. Tasteful enough that it became the biggest crossover hit of all-time, bringing in Country/Western and Rap listeners together."

    title: Higher Love
    artist: Steve Winwood
    year: "1986"
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Blue-eyed soul
    commentary: I always love it when an artist manages to successfully combine a tried-and-true genre like Funk with a contemporary genre. That’s exactly what Winwood did with Synthpop in 1986. Perfectly placed synths and gated reverb combined with a funky guitar and a soulful vocal performance by Winwood. You can always tell by songs like these that the person who made it did so with passion and talent. Winwood, of course, having been in progressive rock band Traffic proves my point.
  - position: 168
    title: Band On The Run
    artist: Paul McCartney & Wings
    year: "1974"
    genres:
      - Rock
    commentary: "My one and only solo McCartney song to be featured on this list. I have to admit, that despite McCartney having the most #1 hits as a solo Beatle, I can’t stand a lot of them. They are either too boring or too weird, and not in a good way either; he’s very much a hit-or-miss pop song writer for me. However, this song was a massive bullseye for me. It takes the best of pop sensibilities and combines them with a very prog rock song structure. It’s also immaculately produced. The main chorus with those dreamy 12-string acoustic chords is just amazing and fun to listen to. This one’s got my approval."
  - position: 167
    title: Rolling in the Deep
    artist: Adele
    year: "2011"
    genres:
      - Soul
      - Pop
      - R&B
    commentary: The song that put Adele on the map, and a great one! When I first heard this song, I mistaken it for an Amy Winehouse song originally, as they both have a similar style and voice. However, that’s not to take away from this anthem. It came out at just the right time. When most pop music was at its worst for production quality and every artist just NEEDED to incorporate electronic bass drops for some reason, Adele comes out with this extremely soulful and catchy break-up song. That chorus is just perfect; Aretha Franklin is smiling down on Adele, for sure.
  - position: 166
    title: Heartless
    artist: The Weeknd
    year: "2019"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Trap
    commentary: "The last contemporary #1 hit of the 2010s, this banger trap rap song is just fantastic. The ethereal synthwave production with that gritty trap beat and The Weeknd’s buttery R&B voice make for a great song. Plus, that opening lyric of “Never need a bitch, I’m what a bitch need” is something I wish I wrote. The thing that sends this song into the stratosphere for is that bridge section. It’s so airy and ethereal that it’s almost like an out-of-body experience."
  - position: 165
    title: Can't Feel My Face
    artist: The Weeknd
    year: "2015"
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Disco
      - Funk
    commentary: This one’s just catchy as hell; that funk bass groove is unmatched, and The Weeknd’s voice is just great here. It’s also got some very clever lyrics; it sounds like it’s about a girl, but it’s really just a neat metaphor for drugs. When a song with a serious topic sounds innocuous, you know that it’s well-written. I think anyone who was around during the ‘70s/’80s funk era will enjoy this one.
  - position: 164
    title: The Hills
    artist: The Weeknd
    year: "2015"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Trap
    commentary: A sinister sounding dark synth trap rap song, after hearing those first seconds, I knew this was going to be one of my favorites of the 2010s. Those low bass synths stabs that start the song are just so gritty and metal AF. However, easily part of the song is the way the “I only called you when it’s half-past five” lyric leading into that bass drop for the chorus. It goes so hard; it’s just makes you go “damn!” and lock into the groove. If there is a song to get your friends into trap rap, THIS is where you start them!
  - position: 163
    title: Walk Like an Egyptian
    artist: The Bangles
    year: 1986/87
    genres:
      - Pop rock
    commentary: A bit of a novelty pop song, but at its heart it’s a rock song. The Bangles weren’t just a female pop group, but competent musicians… instruments, and all. The song may be lacking that eastern-sound, but the use of eastern instruments is very tasteful and blend well with the ‘80s rock sound. Plus, that “way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh” lyric during the chorus is just too mesmerizing to NOT sing. It’s like the auditory equivalent of a snake-charmer.
  - position: 162
    title: Teenage Dream
    artist: Katy Perry
    year: "2010"
    genres:
      - Electropop
      - Power Pop
    commentary: A lust-filled love pop song, much like how “California Gurls” is a re-imagining of the Beach Boys song of similar name, I feel like this is a re-imagining of Bob Seger’s “Night Moves”. The similarities in lyric content are uncanny to say at least. However, that’s not to say this is a lesser song; it’s insanely catchy and the vocal cadence set by Perry on the chorus is something that’s hard NOT to sing. It’s also very well-produced and composed; at this point in time, Perry probably had the monopoly on well-produced pop songs.
  - position: 161
    title: Papa Was a Rollin' Stone
    artist: The Temptations
    year: "1972"
    genres:
      - Psychedelic rock
      - Funk
    commentary: The epitome of Funk rock badassery. The way that the slinky, chicka-chicka guitar locks into that bass and drum groove is unmatched. Its also a bit of a sleeper-hit, clocking in at nearly 7 minutes long with an instrumental intro that’s nearly 2 minutes long! Pop songs just aren’t made this way, but sometimes if it grooves hard enough, it could be 30 minutes long and people won’t care. Throw in some tasteful strings and horns here and there, and you got yourself a hit song to last the ages.
  - position: 160
    title: Mack the Knife
    artist: Bobby Darin
    year: "1959"
    genres:
      - Traditional pop
      - Jazz
    commentary: The only entry on this list that is from the Big Band era of pop, this is such a timeless classic. Not only is it catchy and engaging, but it’s extremely well-composed and performed. The swingy nature of the song matches well with Darin’s smooth delivery, and the whole song is just collection of verses that continue to build up in power finishing with that belted out lyric “Now that Maaaaaaaackies’ back in tooooooown!” at the climax. A song to put one in a good mood, for sure… and then you read the lyrics and realize it’s about a rapist and killer. Ha!

    title: I'll Make Love To You
    artist: Boyz II Men
    year: "1994"
    genres:
      - R&B
    commentary: The “Let’s Get It On” of the ‘90s, these dudes suave and smooth talk their way to the top of the charts with this song about the birds and the bees. I will say, the production is a bit dated but what puts this song on the list is their phenomenal vocal performance. Love ‘em or hate ‘em, these guys were THE best-sounding R&B group of the ‘90s. Their ability to harmonize were unmatched, as demonstrated by that soaring chorus section.
  - position: 158
    title: Heartaches by the Number
    artist: Guy Mitchell
    year: "1959"
    genres:
      - Country
    commentary: "A simple, swingy country tune; this humble track is one that I have a heavy bias towards. Had I only heard this song just the one time I would have for this project, I probably would have passed on it. However, after having played hundreds of hours of Fallout: New Vegas, I can’t help but love this song. The post-apocalyptic open-world RPG game has a stellar soundtrack composed of some classic ‘30s-‘50s hit songs, and at first you probably were annoyed every time your character walked into a bombed out shelter hearing these songs on a beat-up radio, but after the 100 hour mark or so, you’ll find yourself singing every song from memory wishing every game had this soundtrack."
  - position: 157
    title: Footloose
    artist: Kenny Loggins
    year: "1984"
    genres:
      - Yacht rock
    commentary: Probably the greatest theme song ever written for a film. Kenny Loggins, having been a folk/country songwriter in his group Loggins & Messina, he found himself in the ‘80s being one of the biggest pop-stars. This dude was in massive demand, and when he was tasked with writing the title track for this film, he knocked it out of the park. Never has a song fitted the theme for a film so well; with a bouncy, bluesy guitar lick, some earwormy synths, and an extremely catchy chorus, you’re bound to get and dance to this song.
  - position: 156
    title: Nice For What
    artist: Drake
    year: "2018"
    genres:
      - Bounce
    commentary: "I really can’t say I like any of the Drake tracks to reach #1 to be honest… except this one. THIS one is a total banger. What makes this one great is a combination of a tight beat, composed of an urgent hi-hat rhythm with an expertly placed kick snares pattern, and a Lauryn Hill vocal sample. It’s much different from the other songs he’s done, and his performance is also top-notch. His flows on this one are phenomenal and with the song’s lyrics about female empowerment from the man’s perspective, it was bound to be a classic."
  - position: 155
    title: Honky Tonk Women
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    year: "1969"
    genres:
      - Hard rock
      - Rock and roll
    commentary: "This straight, no-frills Blue Rock track was an unsuspecting #1 hit for sure. At a time when psychedelic rock and edgeless flower-power pop was the law of the land, we had The Rolling Stones pumping out one of the best bar-room anthems to ever be written. Top-notch blue guitar work by Keith Richards with Charlie Watts in the pocket behind the drum kit, and Mick Jagger’s “gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky-tonk blues” refrain make for a great song."

    title: Maneater
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    year: 1982/83
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Soul
      - New wave
    commentary: A soft and subtle synthpop song, yet epic in it’s scope, Hall & Oates managed to pull off a feat of ‘80s songwriting. There were hardly any songs at the time with the vibe this song had; it was either an upbeat dance song or an artsy-fartsy new wave composition. This song combined both into this minor-key masterpiece. Oh yeah, and that Saxophone solo is legendary.

    title: What a Fool Believes
    artist: The Doobie Brothers
    year: "1979"
    genres:
      - Soft rock
      - Blue-eyed soul
    commentary: "Composed by keyboardist Michael McDonald, this Yacht Rock classic reeks of late ‘70s nostalgia. That’s a good thing, by the way. The smooth vocal delivery of McDonald with those driving piano chords, and the laid-back beat on the drums, you got one hell of an earworm. It’s funny to think this was one of two #1 hits for the Doobie Brothers, considering the Blue Rock cloth they are cut from, but sometimes you just got to let the Yacht Rocker in the band do his piece and sometimes that gives you your biggest hit to date."
  - position: 152
    title: Beat It
    artist: Michael Jackson
    year: "1983"
    genres:
      - Hard rock
      - Dance-rock
    commentary: Michael Jackson wrote this over the course of a night and recorded it onto a tape recorder with every part of the composition being beatboxed; he brought it to his producer, and they got to work translating it to a full band and what we got was one of the greatest crossover hits of rock and pop we’ve ever seen. They even got guitar virtuoso Eddie Van Halen to do the guitar solo; if that’s not a sign of the diplomatic power MJ had between genres, then I don’t know what would be one.

    title: You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet
    artist: Bachman-Turner Overdrive
    year: "1974"
    genres:
      - Rock
    commentary: "Another straight rock number to hit #1, this one has an outstanding rhythm; it feels like we are out on the open-road trucking along and those tasteful reverberated guitar licks really make the song sound epic. Take a funky rhythm guitar and some tongue-in-cheek lyrics and you got yourself a pop rock anthem. Oh yeah, and you gotta love those distorted guitar chords on the chorus!"

    title: Starboy
    artist: The Weeknd feat. Daft Punk
    year: "2017"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Electropop
    commentary: "Biased as hell om this pick; I friggin’ love Daft Punk. I’m still salty that “Blurred Lines” by Robin Thicke kept Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” out of the #1 spot in 2013, so consider this pick revenge. However, is it any good? The answer is yes. The production on this track is immaculate and distinctly Daft Punk in it’s sound. The Weeknd also manages to pump a great performance on vocals with the help of Daft Punk vocoder on the chorus. Just a great electro-R&B song, through in through."

    title: Get Back
    artist: The Beatles w/ Billy Preston
    year: "1969"
    genres:
      - Blues rock
    commentary: Did you know that The Beatles broke up twice? The first time was in early 1969 when George Harrison walked out due to creative differences right in the mind of recording their final album. However, Billy Preston, a colleague of the band, convinced him to stick around and finish the album and one the songs we got from that convincing is one of the greatest bluesy jam rock songs of all-time. Mainly written by Paul McCartney, this one features some stellar guitar work from Harrison and some fantastic keyboard solos by Preston, the man who managed to save the band even if it was for only a few months (They would officially break up in August 1969).

    title: Here Comes the Hotstepper
    artist: Ini Kamoze
    year: "1994"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Reggae fusion
    commentary: Ini Kamoze for the most part is mainly a dancehall artist, but in the mid-90s during the golden age of west-coast hip hop, he decided to throw his hat into the ring with this reggae fusion hip hop track, and he friggin’ nailed it. Built upon a solid funk foundation and a tasteful patois on his part, this song carries with it a swagger that is unmatched. The “murder-ah” refrain during the chorus is sure to make you bust a move and Kamoze’s flows hold the fort down so well that no tropical storm can blow the roof off this banger.
  - position: 147
    title: Holding Back the Years
    artist: Simply Red
    year: "1986"
    genres:
      - Sophisti-pop
      - Blue-eyed soul
      - Soft rock
    commentary: This one’s a bit of an arty-farty pop song, but don’t let that fool you. This is a pop staple of the ‘80s, and bit of an underrated classic. This song wears its smooth jazz influences on its sleeve, and Mick Hucknall’s vocals are powerful and very soulful. The trumpet break in the middle of the song is pleasant and subtle, and the whole song leads up to an impressive vocal run by Hucknall at the end.
  - position: 146
    title: Dreamlover
    artist: Mariah Carey
    year: "1993"
    genres:
      - Pop
      - R&B
    commentary: My favorite song of Mariah Carey’s catalogue (as a solo artist mind you, hint-hint, wink-wink), this laid back, hopeful-sounding R&B song is her at her best. A solid drum beat, some simple piano chords and Carey’s outstanding vocal performance are what make this so great; the chorus is extremely catchy and the stacked vocals bring out the whimsical vibe of the song very well. Also, the production quality of the song is out of this world; it sounds like it could have been made in the early ‘00s.
  - position: 145
    title: (Just Like) Starting Over
    artist: John Lennon
    year: 1980/81
    genres:
      - Rock
    commentary: "A throwback to the old days of Rock N’ Roll; this is quite a sad and tragic #1 hit. Originally, critics and fans didn’t like this song all that much, but after Lennon was murdered in December 1980, listeners sent this song to the top of the charts. What makes it so sad is that it was clear that Lennon was returning to his roots as an artist and was on the precipice of reinventing himself as an artist for the ‘80s, but since his life was cut so short, we never got to see that. As for the song itself, it’s a solid old-timey rock number with that top-notch ’80s production quality. I have a feeling that if we got more Lennon in the ‘80s, we would have gotten more #1 hits from him."

    title: Rock with You
    artist: Michael Jackson
    year: "1980"
    genres:
      - Disco
      - Funk
    commentary: This is where MJ proved himself as a competent solo artist, and a force to be reckoned with for the upcoming ‘80s decade. This humble post-disco song demonstrates Jackson’s amazing vocal control with one of his most vulnerable performances ever. The song has an unshakeable groove and the way that bridge section leads into that woodwind instrumental break is just great.

    title: Sister Golden Hair
    artist: America
    year: "1975"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Soft rock
    commentary: Sometimes, you just gotta appreciate a good folk rock song. This one tells the story of a man who’s uncertain if he’s ready for marriage with the love of his life; the somber chord progression with that steady beat hammers home the message of the song. Throw in a catchy chorus and you got yourself a folk rock hit. The best part of the song is easily the lyrics; they are simple yet clever. Another case of “a song for songwriters”.

    title: Sailing
    artist: Christopher Cross
    year: "1980"
    genres:
      - Soft rock
      - Yacht rock
    commentary: "This was the song that killed yacht rock. I’m not implying that’s a bad thing; it’s just that I can’t imagine anyone written a better song in this sub-genre of soft rock. It’s quite the magnum opus of that smooth and relaxing style of rock. Everything about it is perfectly composed: The somber string section intro, the ethereal guitar tone with that distinct riff, Cross’ nasally vocals, and a song that’s literally about sailing, it’s just the perfect yacht rock song. It was such a genre killer that Cross won 5 Grammy’s at the 1981 ceremony, going 4 for 4 in the general categories of Best Song, Best Record, Best Album, and Best New Artist."

    genres:
      - Folk rock
    commentary: One of the most recognizable intros of all-time, that minor key arpeggiated guitar chord with that macabre and depressing welcoming line of “hello darkness my old friend, I’ve come to talk with you again”. This was the song that single-handedly set the tone of the Vietnam-era America. It’s extremely well-composed and performed and is an instant classic, and I really, REALLY wanted to rank it much higher. However, this single version is from 1966 which took the original 1964 recording and added a needless electric guitar and a heavily reverberated drum kit. It unfortunately takes away from the vibe of the song but even then, the spirit of the song still carries through the muddled mix.

    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1966"
    genres:
      - Hard rock
      - Power pop
      - Psychedelic rock
    commentary: "The most badass the Beatles sounded during their Beatlemania days! It’s got this awesome distorted guitar riff and Ringo Starr’s drumming on this is fantastic. The vocal harmonization after each chorus is something so good that I can’t remember a single song from the ‘60s that could match it. People at the time may have seen The Beatles as being the more poppy and less edgy band to come out of the British Invasion, but they also tend to forget that they were just as competent at making a hard rock banger. Case in point: this song."

    title: Me and Bobby McGee
    artist: Janis Joplin
    year: "1971"
    genres:
      - Blues rock
      - Country rock
    commentary: "A nice folk rock song, this tells the story of a hobo drifter and her musical lover. Written by Kris Kristofferson and given to Janis Joplin, this was the last she recorded before her death. Another case of a tragic #1 hit, her powerful, gravelly vocal performance was her at her best and it’s just sad to listen to. A song that demonstrates her fantastic talent on display, it’s just a tragic reminder of what could have been had she lived on into the ‘70s."

    title: Who Can It Be Now?
    artist: Men At Work
    year: "1982"
    genres:
      - Pop rock
      - New wave
    commentary: In late 1982 and early 1983, Men At Work were probably the biggest band in America. These Aussie rockers had the amazing knack of blending the fresh, new wave sound with classic pop sensibilities. This one’s best known for its heavily recognizable and rockin’ Saxaphone riff and its catchy chorus. However, it’s very much a new wave song through in through, with expertly executed reverberated guitar licks and contemplative lyrics about a paranoic hermit who think everyone is out to get him.

    title: I'm a Believer
    artist: The Monkees
    year: 1966/67
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: One of the most poppy songs of the flower-power era, sometimes if you just lean hard into pop trends, you can get the best poppy pop song of the late ‘60s, and that’s exactly what Neil Diamond did with this one. Of course, giving this song to The Monkees, the biggest pop group at the time, was a no-brainer. This song is basically a synthesis of all of the best qualities of pop music at the time and even then, it manages to sound timeless.

    title: Poker Face
    artist: Lady Gaga
    year: "2009"
    genres:
      - Synth-pop
      - Dance-pop
    commentary: I like to think of this song as an even better and more well-composed version of “Just Dance”. Gaga makes use of well-crafted spooky-sounding synths and some clever poker metaphors that suit the theme of the song very well. Her vocal performance is also top-notch; combine that with an impeccable production quality and you got probably the best synthpop song to end the ‘00s decade.

    title: Bad, Bad Leroy Brown
    artist: Jim Croce
    year: "1973"
    genres:
      - Boogie-woogie
    commentary: A timeless classic; this song is a throwback to the old boogie-woogie days of rock, and despite being a decade or so out of fashion, it’s what I think is the best song of the genre. Croce’s amazing written skills are all on display here; not only does he make the song extremely catchy and singable, but the song’s lyrical content is just a ton of fun. It’s a blast listening to the story of the tough-as-nails gambler that nobody crosses get their comeuppance by some rando at a bar.

    title: Sukiyaki
    artist: Kyu Sakamoto
    year: "1963"
    genres:
      - J-pop
      - Vocal
    commentary: "The only J-pop song to every reach #1, and it was made in the early ‘60s! Back then, the crooner pop star was all the rage in Japan, and through some effective marketing (The song’s title is a common Japanese dish, but he song’s lyrics have nothing to do with it), Sakamoto managed to have the only #1 hit that was sung in Japanese. The song’s composition is pretty standard for a pop song, but once you look up the translated lyrics, you realize that the song is about a man who keeps their head up as to not lets his tears fall. The song’s jovial sound is contrasted by Sakamoto’s fantastic vocal performance. It matches the song so well; he sounds like a man trying to sound happy and unaffected, but his voice is tinged with a vibrato that makes it sound like he’s on a verge of bursting in tears from bottling up his sadness."
  - position: 133
    title: All 4 Love
    artist: Color Me Badd
    year: "1992"
    genres:
      - New jack swing
    commentary: "I remember listening this song at my job at Lowe’s and being frustrated that I couldn’t tell who it was. Then while working my way through the ‘90s section of this project, this song came on and was like: “Oh, this is who did this song!” and it’s even better than I remember. This extremely upbeat pop song is carried by a fantastic vocal performance by the four members of the group. Each one brings a unique timbre to the song, and the high-energy they bring to the song makes it a classic. It’s a shame that this “late ‘80s – early ‘90s” sound in pop was so short-lived."

    title: Cream
    artist: Prince & The New Power Generation
    year: "1991"
    genres:
      - Funk
      - Glam rock
      - Pop rock
      - R&B
    commentary: You could always count on Prince to make some of the most provocative songs of the era he was in; this song is a funk rock masterpiece. That driving 4-on-the-floor rhythm is made legendary by the snappy tone of the snare drum, and Prince’s tasteful guitar licks throughout the song are the icing on the cake. The laid-back nature of the song fits the sexy theme of the song so well; this was probably a big hit in strip clubs throughout the ‘90s, for sure.
  - position: 131
    title: Let Your Love Flow
    artist: The Bellamy Brothers
    year: "1976"
    genres:
      - Country pop
      - Country rock
      - Soft rock
    commentary: A diamond in the rough from a year of boring soft pop songs and dawdling disco numbers; we had these two perform one of the most upbeat and catchy country songs of all-time. When that chorus kicks in, it makes you feel like a million bucks and you can’t help but feel that everything will be okay and the message of the song, one of enjoying your life and loving unconditionally, reinforces that vibe extremely well. If you are ever in a bad mood, just put this song on and let your worries melt away.
  - position: 130
    title: Southern Nights
    artist: Glen Campbell
    year: "1977"
    genres:
      - Country pop
      - Soft rock
    commentary: Campbell may have been a country star at heart, but this funky, ragtimey pop song shows that a great artist can always transcend genres. Very similar to previous Bellamy Brothers song on this list, this is a song you can always count on to put you a good mood and is a great ambassador for the American South. I put it up there with “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Georgia On My Mind”; it’s that good in my opinion.
  - position: 129
    title: Empire State of Mind
    artist: Jay-Z feat. Alicia Keys
    year: "2009"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
    commentary: "Speaking of great ambassadors for a U.S. region/state, here we have probably the best song about the Empire State to ever come out this century. There are three things that make this song great: The nostalgic sampling of “Love on a Two-Way Street” by The Moments, Jay-Z’s heartfelt reminiscing about his early years, and Alicia Keys fantastic vocal performance on the chorus “There streets will make you feel brand-new, big lights will inspire you, let’s hear it for New York, New York, New York!” Maybe someday I’ll get to visit the Big Apple, and I’ll have this song in mind if I get there!"

    title: My Girl
    artist: The Temptations
    year: "1965"
    genres:
      - Soul
      - R&B
    commentary: "Very rarely does a guitar-riff drive an R&B song, but when it does, not only is it extremely catchy, but also very legendary. Case in point: this Smokey Robinson song sung by The Temptations. Besides the great use of guitar on this song, the laid-back bassline and dreamy vocal performance by the group makes this a classic that will always stand the test of time."
  - position: 127
    title: Help Me, Rhonda
    artist: The Beach Boys
    year: "1965"
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: "I have a soft-spot for some “fun-in-the-sun, summertime” Beach Boys. This song is one of two songs from this era in their career to reach #1, and I think this one is the better of the two. It’s cheery and upbeat nature is complimented by a fantastic and well-harmonized vocal performance by the group. It’s also got this awesome boogie-woogie instrumental break in the middle. If there was anything that Brian Wilson was good at, it was taking simple poppy pop songs and making them sound bigger and more epic than anything you’ve ever heard."
  - position: 126
    title: Out of Touch
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    year: "1984"
    genres:
      - Dance-rock
      - New wave
      - Synth-pop
    commentary: "A song I always crank up when playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City on my PlayStation 2, this is a masterpiece of gritty synthpop. Those bass synths almost make this song could an industrial rock song, while still being extremely catchy and upbeat. That chorus is soooo good, I can’t believe it isn’t typically considered one of the best of the ‘80s; very underrated in retrospect, for sure. Next time you’re running from the cops in your Lamborghini after having run over dozens of people and you’ve got 5 stars with FBI and Helicopters trying to stop you, you can always count on this song to bring your spirits up! (This in a video game, mind you; I don’t condone violence)."
  - position: 125
    title: Babe
    artist: Styx
    year: "1979"
    genres:
      - Soft rock
    commentary: Sometimes a simple pop song is just so good at its core that you’ve just got to love it. This is a song written by Styx vocalist & keyboardist Dennis DeYoung for his wife Suzzanne as a birthday present. Driven by a series of twinkly and pleasant-sounding keyboard chords, this is a masterpiece of “the simple love song”. By the way, him and his wife have been married for over 51 years, so you know that when he wrote this song, he meant it.
  - position: 124
    title: The Monster
    artist: Eminem feat. Rihanna
    year: 2013/14
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Pop
    commentary: It’s songs like this that demonstrate not only Eminem’s fantastic rapping skills but also his writing skills. The song tackles the topic of him dealing with his own alter-ego while being a successful rapper. ”I ain't here to save the fuckin' children but if one kid out of a hundred million Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!” Is probably one of the best lyrics of the 2010s, and Rihanna’s amazing vocal performance on the chorus is just insanely catchy and singable; a timeless classic.
  - position: 123
    title: '"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)”'
    artist: George Harrison
    year: "1973"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Gospel
    commentary: A song that I originally thought was “meh”, this one has grown on me. Harrison was a very spiritual person and a devout Hindu, and this song is a testament of his devotion. The somber chord progression, the vulnerable vocal performance by Harrison with lyrics about facing your own mortality, and some tasteful slide guitar licks, make this is a masterpiece of gospel folk rock. This song hits the nail on the head with making the listener feel closer to God, something that an overwhelming majority of Christian/Religious pop fails at, in my opinion.
  - position: 122
    title: It's Too Late/I Feel the Earth Move
    artist: Carole King
    year: "1971"
    genres:
      - Soft rock / Pop rock
    commentary: Another double single, these two songs are masterpieces of combining the best elements of Funk, Soft Rock, and Soul music. King’s voice is on-point and the instrumentation that back her performances are extremely tasteful. No wonder why people consider the album these two songs are on, “Tapestry”, to be one of the greatest. There was no one in the early ‘70s who could match King’s ability to cross-pollinate genres. If you want to hear a more laid-back sound, “It’s Too Late” is your song. If you’d rather bust-a-move and groove, “I Feel the Earth Move” is what you need.
  - position: 121
    title: Heart of Gold
    artist: Neil Young
    year: "1972"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Country
      - Soft rock
    commentary: I’m still amazed by this song. It’s production quality, mixing, and composition make it sound like something a folkish alt rock band from the ‘90s would write. The simple kick-snare beat combined with that soulful harmonica and Neil Young’s “heartful” vocal performance make this a song worth remembering.
  - position: 120
    title: You've Got A Friend
    artist: James Taylor
    year: "1971"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Soft rock
    commentary: A nice little, humble, folk song about friendship. It’s as if James Taylor is singing quietly to someone who is asleep, as to not wake them; really gives the song a special kind of character that no song on this list has. A song so warm, like a fireplace in winter. My favorite part of the song is easily the bridge, that chord progression is just perfect, fantastic acoustic guitar work. Maybe someday I’ll be able to play the whole song (It sounds easy, but it’s actually really hard).
  - position: 119
    title: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)
    artist: Eurythmics
    year: "1983"
    genres:
      - Synth-pop
      - New wave
    commentary: The synthpop song that put synthpop on the map. Technically, this honor belongs to “Don’t You Want Me” by The Human League, but I think this song is much, much better. The whole song is tinged with this vibe, like it was made by a mad scientist or some technocratic hermit. They went all out on the synths with this one, and it really worked in their favor. Not to mention Annie Lennox’s outstanding vocal performance and the ominous lyrics; this whole song is a synthpop overload in all the right ways.
  - position: 118
    title: Blank Space
    artist: Taylor Swift
    year: 2014/15
    genres:
      - Electropop
    commentary: This floaty, dreamy-sounding electropop song is probably the furthest Swift has strayed from her beginnings as a teen country star, but despite the “sell out” appearance of her career at this point, she really hit her peak with this song. The heavily reverberated synths, the simple snare/hi-hat rhythm, the scotch snaps in Swift’s vocal cadence, her amazing vocal control throughout the song, and the ethereal chorus section all make for one of the best pop masterpieces of the 2010s.
  - position: 117
    title: See You Again
    artist: Wiz Khalifa feat. Charlie Puth
    year: "2015"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Pop-rap
    commentary: This song was written as a eulogy and tribute to Fast & Furious actor Paul Walker who died in a car accident. You’d think that taking a pop singer and a pop rapper and making a contemporary pop song for them to perform would have resulted in a plasticky, soulless, cash-in. Instead, it’s an extremely catchy yet somber, faithful tribute to the man. Both Puth and Khalifa give great performances and the lyrical content is wholesome and pleasant. This one’s a worthy contender to “One Sweet Day” in this niche category.
  - position: 116
    title: Need You Tonight
    artist: INXS
    year: "1988"
    genres:
      - Funk rock
    commentary: Australian New Wave band INXS were very similar to Men At Work in how they crossed New Wave with another genre, but INXS were more of a funk rock band instead of a Pop rock band in that regard. This song being not only a great example of how they accomplished that, but also a great example of a legendary staple of funk rock for the ‘80s decade. The clacking and smacking of the rhythm section combined with that slinky guitar riff and the seductive vocal performance by Michael Hutchence showed that they were more than just some dime-a-dozen new wave group, but instead masterful musicians.
  - position: 115
    title: All You Need Is Love
    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1967"
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Psychedelia
    commentary: The flower-power anthem to end all flower-power anthems, this quaint and somber ballad was more than just a song, but a breakthrough in how music was experienced. I’m of course talking about it’s broadcast via satellite to over 400 million people, making it not only one of the first proper music videos, but one the biggest to have ever been watched in all human history, and they could have not picked a better song for the occasion. John Lennon delivers one of his most vulnerable performances of his lifetime, and the “all you need is love” refrain during the chorus combined with that horn and string section make for one of the most accessible pop songs of all-time.
  - position: 114
    title: Humble
    artist: Kendrick Lamar
    year: "2017"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
    commentary: Kendrick Lamar is easily one of the best rappers of the 2010s, and although I’ve heard even better songs of his than this one, “Humble” is still a great song from this era of rap. This is the classic “braggadocious” rap song, with a chorus that probably has the word “bitch” repeated more times during the chorus than any other in history, just to hammer the theme home. However, don’t let the profanities scare you away; Lamar’s catchy and skillful flows and clever lyrical delivery are him on his A-game and the simple, piano riff that drives the song is the kind of thing that makes you wanna jump through a brickwall like the Kool-Aid man.
  - position: 113
    title: Circles
    artist: Post Malone
    year: 2019/20
    genres:
      - Pop rock
      - Soft rock
      - Downtempo
    commentary: I had never heard this song before I started this project, and I was pleasantly surprised that Post Malone, an artist that I associated with trap rap, was such a competent indie pop artist too! Well, at least an indie pop performer. This sounds like it could be Tame Impala or a Foster The People song; the song has this ethereal vibe that washes over all the instruments, including Post Malone’s voice, which is tinged with a vibrato that gives his performance a feeling of desperation, which suits the theme of the song very well. I’m interested in seeing where he goes creatively after this.
  - position: 112
    title: Black or White
    artist: Michael Jackson
    year: 1991/92
    genres:
      - Pop rock
      - Hip hop
    commentary: This guitar-driven, upbeat, and cheery pop rock song is more than just a catchy song to dance along to, it’s a song of racial harmony and peace. The song was composed around this theme so well that I doubt any artist could make a song to match this one, regarding the topic at hand. Oh yeah, it’s a bit out of left field, but there’s this badass, rockin’ bridge section after the first chorus that sounds so metal, you can’t help to bang your head a bit. It just goes to show you that MJ appreciated all types of music, and now thinking about now, suits the theme of the song well.
  - position: 111
    title: Owner of a Lonely Heart
    artist: Yes
    year: "1984"
    genres:
      - Dance-rock
    commentary: "I was REALLY tempted to just stick this song as my #1 favorite #1 hit of all-time, as I am a massive fan of Yes, and of progressive rock. However, I ultimately decided to place it here purely on context and principle. It’s a damn good song, but it’s far from a legendary masterpiece. However, don’t let that take away from the fact that this song is an absolute banger and an outstanding synthesis of the artsy-fartsy prog rock of the early ‘70s and ‘80s pop rock. This song has easily the best breakdown of any #1 hit I’ve ever heard, the build up to that amazing vocal harmony, followed by a barrage of breakbeat samples that lead into the song’s legendary guitar solo is something that is unmatched to this day."
  - position: 110
    title: Someone Like You
    artist: Adele
    year: "2011"
    genres:
      - Soul
      - Pop
      - R&B
    commentary: Co-written with former ‘90s rock band Semisonic front-man Dan Wilson, this urgent and yet somber piano ballad is a masterpiece of Soul in a year of overproduced electronic pop hits. It just goes to show you that Soul music is timeless and there will never be a year where this kind of music is out of style. Adele is more than qualified to carry on the torch, and this was her magnum opus (up until this point; hint-hint, wink-wink). Some people may think her vocal performance here is a bit shrill, but I think it fits the heartbroken theme of the song so well that it cancels that out. Let’s also not ignore the fantastic piano arrangement by Dan Wilson here; masterful work.
  - position: 109
    title: Pick Up the Pieces
    artist: Average White Band
    year: "1975"
    genres:
      - Funk
      - Jazz-funk
    commentary: Who would have thought that band of literal white guys would pump out one of the single most funky funk songs of the ‘70s? It was probably more of a surprise to them than anyone else that people took to it so well, but why would they be surprised? Sometimes you just gotta pat yourself on the back. This quasi-instrumental is a masterpiece of jazz fusion and funk. Everything here is so well-composed; The slinky guitars, the consistent bassline, the steady drummer in the pocket, and the soaring horn section make this song infectiously danceable. They deserve all the praise they can get.
  - position: 108
    title: Blurred Lines
    artist: Robin Thicke feat. T.I. & Pharrell Williams
    year: "2013"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Pop
    commentary: A song that I’m still salty about, keeping “Get Lucky” by Daft Punk out of the top spot for the whole summer of 2013, I’ve ultimately decided that it is, indeed, the better song of the two. This song is an obvious tribute to the funk and soul of Marvin Gaye. Maybe a bit too much of a tribute, as the Gaye Estate sued them (and succeeded) for infringing the song “Gotta Give It Up” by Marvin Gaye. I think the suit was complete bullshit, and you know what, I’ll say it… I think this song is better. This song is on my list, and Gaye’s song isn’t. Take that as you will but even if you disagree with that assessment, there’s no denying that this song is funk masterpiece and easily one of the catchiest song of the 2010s.
  - position: 107
    title: Penny Lane
    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1967"
    genres:
      - Psychedelic pop
      - Progressive pop
      - Baroque pop
    commentary: A bit of an artsy-fartsy pop song, but hey… it’s the Beatles… you think if they get a bit proggy, they WON’T make it catchy and memorable? This Baroque-sounding song is so painfully British, with references to the Queen of England, who is still by the way, the SAME queen today. Joking aside, this has an amazing use of a downward key-shift during the chorus, which is hardly used in pop music. If anything, THIS is the golden standard of how to write a song with experimental elements and still be a pop masterpiece.
  - position: 106
    title: It Wasn't Me
    artist: Shaggy feat. Ricardo 'Rikrok' Ducent
    year: "2001"
    genres:
      - Reggae
      - R&B
    commentary: If “Me & Mrs. Jones” by Billy Paul is about having a sensual affair with a woman, then this is the comedic sequel about what happens when you get CAUGHT. However, the tongue-in-cheek nature of the song doesn’t take away from the fact that this is a masterpiece of R&B and Reggae. Both Rikrok and Shaggy give amazing performances of their respective genres, with Rikrok giving us buttery smooth vocals during the R&B pre-chorus and chorus, and Shaggy delivering a fantastic patois on the Reggae verses. On top of that, the production quality is top-notch, and the funk of this song is undeniable.
  - position: 105
    title: Ticket to Ride
    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1965"
    genres:
      - Power pop
      - Jangle pop
      - Folk rock
    commentary: To be honest, I only ranked this song as high as I did because of George Harrison’s use of the 12-string Rickenbacker electric guitar. However, even if the 12-string was absent, it’s still a fantastic song of the British Invasion era of pop music. The staggered tom-tom/snare rhythm by Ringo Starr and the consistent use of the tambourine really puts you in the sonic sounds of the ‘60s hippie movement so well, that it may just be the best song to represent the movement as a whole.

    title: Let's Go Crazy
    artist: Prince & The Revolution
    year: "1984"
    genres:
      - Hard rock
      - Funk rock
      - New wave
      - Minneapolis sound
    commentary: Whenever you hear or see the term “Minneapolis sound” being used to describe the sub-genre of Funk/R&B, and you have no clue what that would sound like, put this song on, and you’ll get it right away. Prince was a pioneer of the genre, and this is probably the magnum opus of this sound. I mean, it would have to be with that angelic used of church organs and the opening church sermon by Prince. He tells us to appreciate what life we have and to live it to the fullest. In other words, let’s go crazy! Prince was always a person of contrast, being a devout, goody two-shoes Christian while also being a lustful sex symbol, and this song is an amazing fusion of the two. Oh yeah, and it has probably the greatest big rock outro of any song ever; Prince busts out one hell of a guitar solo and ends the whole song with a heavily distorted, and vocally fried shouting of the line “take me away!” I love it!

    artist: Cardi B feat. Megan Thee Stallion
    year: "2020"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Dirty rap
      - Trap
    commentary: "Yup… that’s right. I liked this song THAT much. Probably the single most dirty and explicit song to ever reach #1 (Yet…), almost cracked my top 100. Why? Well, because it’s ballsy as hell, and I like it when people dance close to the fire of social acceptability. We’ve come a long way from Elvis shaking his hips on grainy, black-and-white TV that’s for sure; this song is a lyrical masterpiece of risqué metaphors and sexual double entendre. Oh yeah, it’s also got this great composition with the whole beat having this simple, chromatic, heavy bassline of B-C-C#. Combined with the simple drum pattern, it gives the song a grit that suits the dirty theme of the song well. Ben Shapiro can get fucked… this is a classic."

    title: (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    year: "1965"
    genres:
      - Blue rock
      - Hard rock
    commentary: At a time when parents thought The Beatles were too hardcore for their kids, along came The Rolling Stones to make them look like little kids with instruments. This song, describing their sexual frustrations, was THE right song to propel them to superstardom; it’s an anthem to last the ages. Did you know that Keith Richards originally wanted the main riff to be played on horns, but ultimately decided to record it on his guitar with the use of a Maestro fuzzbox to emulate the sound of a saxophone? That simple decision is what gave us not only an amazing guitar riff but an amazing guitar tone. This song has probably sold more fuzz pedals than any on the song in the history of guitar.

    title: War
    artist: Edwin Starr
    year: "1970"
    genres:
      - Psychedelic soul
      - Psychedelic funk
    commentary: There will probably never be an anti-war song to top this one. THIS is how you do it! I heard several “anti-war/peace on earth” songs for this project, and none of them comes as close to this banger. The “War! Huh! What is it good for? Absolutely nothin’!” refrain is so damn catchy, and that’s thanks to an impeccably performed horn section. However, it’s more than just a mindless catchy catchfest of a song, if you bother to listen to the lyrics, Edwin Starr is dropping some serious nuggets of wisdom. “War, it ain’t nothin’ but a heartbreaker, friend only to the undertaker” and “Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days, War can’t give life, it can only take it away” are lines you may miss when your busy dancing to this on the dancefloor.

    title: Ridin'
    artist: Chamillionaire feat. Krayzie Bone
    year: "2006"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
    commentary: Besides the catchy and head-bobby chorus; Chamillionaire gives us an insanely good vocal performance with a flow so fast and on-point that it gives Eminem a run for his money. This is complemented by another amazing performance by Krayzie Bone of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony fame. It was like a match made I heaven; two very competent rappers giving the performances of their lifetimes.

    title: Superstition
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    year: "1973"
    genres:
      - Funk
      - Funk rock
    commentary: "This song was the start of a series of #1 hits by Stevie Wonder in the ‘70s that would be legendary, and this is not a bad way to start it all! The whole song’s groove is driven by an amazing electric piano riff performed by Wonder, and I think what makes it so good is how percussive and hoppy it is. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a piano riff with a timbre like this one. Combine that with an outstanding vocal performance by Wonder, a steady drum groove, and a powerful and yet tasteful horn section, and you got yourself a timeless hit"

    title: Mrs. Robinson
    artist: Simon & Garfunkel
    year: "1968"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
    commentary: "A bit more… happy-sounding than “The Sound of Silence”, this #1 hit is just an all-around pleasant experience. The cheery chorus with its surprisingly religious overtones, the bluesy acoustic guitar licks throughout, the duos amazing harmonization, there’s just so much to love about this song. This song was the third song written to be the theme to the 1967 film “The Graduate”, as the film’s director, Mike Nichols, rejected the previous two. I guess we got him to thank for this folk-rock masterpiece, ‘cause if we didn’t have his input, we could have gotten a lesser song out this film (Well, I doubt Paul Simon would write a “bad” song, but it’s always good to have a better one, I suppose)"

    title: Incense and Peppermints
    artist: Strawberry Alarm Clock
    year: "1967"
    genres:
      - Psychedelic pop
      - Psychedelic rock
    commentary: "A song reeking of so much psychedelic rock, that just the sound of it reverberating through the air can manifest beanbag chairs, lava lamps, bell-bottom jeans, and copious amounts of LSD. Like, I can’t think of a song more representative of that late ‘60s “sound” than this one. It’s got everything: Fuzzy distorted guitars, blaring electric organ chords, haunting vocal harmonies, and lyrics that quite literally reference Timothy Leary’s “Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out”. Despite being one of those “far out” songs, it still manages to be quite catchy; an earworm to take you back to those times."

    title: Hello, Dolly!
    artist: Louis Armstrong
    year: "1964"
    genres:
      - Traditional pop
      - Jazz
    commentary: "The one and only Jazz-pop song on this list; Sometimes you just gotta go with a well-crafted and honed sound. By the time this song hit #1, Jazz’s time at the top of the charts was long-gone, but who better to end that legacy of chart-topping Jazz hits than one of the most famous and talented Jazz artists to ever live (At least I think so, if only I listened to more Jazz)? The song’s got this nice swing to it, and is a wash of tasteful ukulele, and trumpet licks. Also, let’s not forget Louis Armstrong’s iconic, raspy vocal performance."
  - position: 95
    title: Give It to Me
    artist: Timbaland feat. Nelly Furtado & Justin Timberlake
    year: "2007"
    genres:
      - Electro
      - Hip hop
    commentary: One of the bangers of the Timbaland-era in pop music, this whole song is really just a couple of pop stars messin’ around in the studio. The song’s structure is based around a simple drumline beat, and a haunting synth riff. Even though this is listed as a Timbaland song, it’s honestly equal parts a Nelly Furtado song and a Justin Timberlake song. Each of them taking a verse to brag about their successes as pop stars. They even joke about how “your songs don’t top the charts” while this song being a chart-topper. It’s like the equivalent of Michael Jordan telling you that you suck at basketball. What are you gonna say? That’s he sucks? You’re kinda put in a position to concede defeat, but in the case of this song, you’ll probably be too busy dancing along and singing the “give it to me, give it to me, give it to me" refrain during the chorus to do so.
  - position: 94
    title: Light My Fire
    artist: The Doors
    year: "1967"
    genres:
      - Psychedelic Rock
      - Baroque pop
      - Acid rock
    commentary: Another classic song of the psychedelic rock era of pop music; it’s similar to Strawberry Alarm Clock’s “Incense and Peppermints” in that it has all of the staples of a good psychedelic rock song. However, the blues influence is something these guys wore on their sleeve proudly. The chorus and vocal performance by Jim Morrison are pretty good, but what makes this song a classic is the outstanding jam section in the middle of the song with the legendary organ solo performed by Ray Manzarek, as well as a banger guitar solo by main writer Robby Krieger. It really sounds way ahead of it’s time while simultaneously sounding like a perfect period piece.
  - position: 93
    title: In Da Club
    artist: 50 Cent
    year: "2003"
    genres:
      - East Coast hip hop
      - Gangsta rap
    commentary: "The single most badass-sounding hip hop song of the ‘00s, no song from this era makes you want march into battle much more than this one. That’s probably why it was #1 during the Invasion of Iraq. Anyway, this song has probably one of the hardest beats ever made, the orchestral synth stabs form what I like to call the “epic” chord progression; it’s probably got an actual name in the music theory sense, but for intents and purposes, it’s the kind of thing that makes you feel like your listening to an epic story unfold. In this case, we’ve got the classic “braggadocious” rap song. My favorite line has got to be easily the “I’m into havin’ sex, I ain’t into makin’ love”. It’s like he’s like yeah, I’m hedonistic. What about it? Whatcha gonna do about it? Call the cops?"
  - position: 92
    title: Bad
    artist: Michael Jackson
    year: "1987"
    genres:
      - Pop rock
    commentary: Speaking of braggadocious songs, here we got the king of pop himself, bragging about how “bad” he is. If your gonna write a song about being hard, you better make it sound hard… and that’s exactly what this soft-spoken, shy, pop star did. Despite his soft demeanor, he managed to pull off the impossible with this insatiably funky number that has this grit about it, that it kinda feels like some long-lost metal classic that got turned into a pop song. It may lack the heavy, distorted guitars, but it has them in spirit. Not to mention that it is immaculately produced and crafted; really set the standard for what makes a good pop song in the late ‘80s.
  - position: 91
    title: Call Me
    artist: Blondie
    year: "1980"
    genres:
      - Dance-rock
      - Hard rock
      - New wave
    commentary: Never has new wave sounded so bad ass! This is probably the closest we’ll probably ever get to a disco punk song topping the charts. This song is a masterpiece of composition. The fast and steady drum beat, the angelic vocals of Debbie Harry, The insanely catchy “call me!” refrain during the chorus, the Black Sabbath-esque riffage on guitar, and the fantastic synth solo by Harold Faltermeyer are what make this a great crossover hit. Not to mention that it was produced by Giorgio Moroder, one of the most prolific electronic producers of the ‘70s and ‘80s.
  - position: 90
    title: She Loves You
    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1964"
    genres:
      - Rock and roll
    commentary: "Easily my favorite Beatles song of the initial wave of Beatlemania. A lot of people like to poo-poo on the poppy early hits of the Beatles, but considering what it was replacing in the pop world, it was like Aliens came down to Earth and gave us the cure to cancer. This was LEAGUES above everything that came before it, case in point: this song. The reverberated vocal harmonies by all the members of the group, the amazing drumming performance by Ringo Starr, the somber guitar chords. It all leads up to that climatic last line “and you know you should…. be glad!” ending on an amazing vocal harmony on the last “yeah!” of the song. I don’t know how people can say this era of the Beatles was trash, this is a masterpiece of pop music."

    title: Blinding Lights
    artist: The Weeknd
    year: "2020"
    genres:
      - Synthwave
      - Synth-pop
      - Electro-pop
    commentary: You can always count on The Weeknd to make a banger of a synthwave song. This one however, I think is his magnum opus. The production quality of this song is so on-point, it’s not even funny. It’s like… the best ‘80s song ever written outside of that decade. The synths are so tasteful and catchy. Also, The Weeknd’s vocal performance is just phenomenal; that chorus is legendary and is guaranteed to lift your spirits. I implore anyone who grew up in the ‘80s who enjoyed the pop music at the time to give this one a listen. I think you’ll like it!
  - position: 88
    title: We Didn't Start the Fire
    artist: Billy Joel
    year: "1989"
    genres:
      - Pop rock
    commentary: As a history buff, I had to include this pop classic onto the list. It’s an interesting pop song, for sure. Billy Joel took the year he was born, 1949, and with an impressive logorrhea, rattles off a collection of world events, people, and pop culture references from that year onward in a sort of retrospective of the cold war. The song’s composition is pretty neat, it’s like a combination of classic ‘50s rock-n-roll, and world beat, what with the heavy use of various percussion and a clavinet. All of these references ultimately illude to the theme of the song “We didn’t start the fire; it was always burning’ since the world’s been turning’”. Great chorus!

    title: Sir Duke
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    year: "1977"
    genres:
      - Funk
      - R&B
      - Pop
    commentary: Probably the happiest sounding song on this list, this song is a tribute to the life of Duke Ellington. However, it’s also a celebration of the power of music has on people and the positives that it brings. What can I say? It’s the single best tribute to a recently passed artist I’ve ever heard. The heavy use of horns and the hoppy, jazzy organ played by Stevie Wonder are clear odes to the jazz legend. However, it also manages to combine the sound of jazz with that of ‘70s funk, and it works so well here. Throw in the catchy “you can feel it all over!” refrain from the chorus, and you have a song to stand the test of time.
  - position: 86
    title: Lose Yourself
    artist: Eminem
    year: 2002/03
    genres:
      - Hardcore hip hop
      - Rap rock
    commentary: Written for the semi-autobiography film, “8 Mile”, this is Eminem’s best song, by far. I don’t think he’ll ever be able to top this one. I’ll admit something to you guys; I get goosebumps listening to that piano intro. The way it leads into that hard rock guitar riff is just fantastic composition. Speaking of fantastic composition, this is probably the best composed rap song of the ‘00s decade. The rhythmic cadence of Eminem’s flows, the aggressive delivery, and the lyrical message of the song; to take that one opportunity you get in life to be the person you want to be, is just fantastic.
  - position: 85
    title: Shining Star
    artist: Earth, Wind & Fire
    year: "1975"
    genres:
      - Progressive soul
      - Funk
    commentary: Another funk masterpiece to last throughout the ages. It’s really hard to NOT like Earth, Wind & Fire. They’re competent musicians and songwriters, and leave it to them to pump out a banger like this one. The low bass line combined with that slinky guitar, horn section, and simple rhythm section give the song a type of funk that only they could do. Take that with Maurice White, Phillip Bailey, and Vedrine White’s great vocal performances, and you’ll be a happy camper, that’s for sure. Also, you gotta love those lyrics. “You’re a shining star, no matter who you are, shining bright to see, what you can truly be”.
  - position: 84
    title: Let It Be
    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1970"
    genres:
      - Rock
      - Gospel
    commentary: This somber piano ballad written by Paul McCartney, came to him in a dream. He was visited by his deceased mother; she could tell he was stressed and tired, and as a way of consoling her son, she told him “don’t worry, it’s gonna be fine… just let it be.” The moment he woke up, he got to writing the song on the piano. The phrase “Mother Mary” in the song is not a reference to the Virgin Mary, but instead Paul’s mother. The song’s message is very moving, and it suits the vibe that was going on in 1970. On top of the great composition, George Harrison gives us a fantastic guitar solo in the middle as well!
  - position: 83
    title: Blinded by the Light
    artist: Manfred Mann's Earth Band
    year: "1977"
    genres:
      - Progressive rock
      - Hard rock
    commentary: Written by Bruce Springsteen, to this day, I have absolutely no clue what this song is about. The lyrics are completely incoherent, but I really don’t care. This is a masterpiece of Prog rock with some of the best organ, guitar, bass, and drum work I’ve ever heard from a ‘70s rock band. The breakdown in the middle of the song is just so damn good with that guitar solo performed by Dave Flett. Let’s also not forget the use of the silly but appropriate “Chopsticks” piano riff; gives the song spunk!
  - position: 82
    title: Yesterday
    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1965"
    genres:
      - Chamber pop
    commentary: A nice, little, simple acoustic ballad written by Paul McCartney, and my favorite bowl-cut era Beatles song. What I love about it is its simplicity. Just a guitar and some subtle strings in the background. This gives way to McCartney’s amazing vocal performance and lyrics that are so simple yet so effective of telling a story.
  - position: 81
    title: I Wish
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    year: "1977"
    genres:
      - Funk
      - pop
    commentary: This little funky ditty was written by Stevie Wonder to reminisce about his care-free youth and all the no-good he got up to as a kid. Smoking cigarettes, spending collection plate money on candy, and other debauchery. The walking bassline is what makes this song. It’s so damn FUNKY! Everything else, the horn section, the electric organ, the powerful vocal performance by Wonder, it all compliments that bassline so well here. Listen, I had to slog through a whole lot of slow and boring songs in the ‘70s decade for this project, but when I got this song, I lit up. No one could do it like Stevie Wonder could in the ‘70s!
  - position: 80
    title: Sicko Mode
    artist: Travis Scott feat. Drake
    year: "2018"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Progressive rap
    commentary: "This is one hell of a trippy hip hop song. It’s basically the closest thing to a “prog rap” song to top the charts… and I love it. This song has THREE key changes, but it’s more than that. Each key change also changes the tempo and vibe as well. The intro has these stunning, soaring synth chords. With a light bit of refrain from Drake, we hard cut into the Travis Scott section with this nasty bassline-driven, beat. Just when you think it’s all over, we hard cut into the final section with Drake and Scott rapping over some twinkly keys. If you go to the YouTube video for this song, you’ll people leaving comments like: “Quick! Hurry and use all the sound effects before the trial expires!” referring to the extensive use of plugins for this production."

    title: Stranger on the Shore
    artist: Mr. Acker Bilk
    year: "1962"
    genres:
      - Easy listening
      - Jazz
    commentary: An extremely pleasant Jazz clarinet instrumental; it really puts the “easy” in easy listening. It’s the perfect musical personification of that feeling you get when everything is alright, and you have no worries. Okay, maybe it’s a fairly standard jazz number and there’s almost certainly more soulful tunes out there, but I’m not one to complain about a song like this one topping the charts. It’s songs like this that give you a short moment of peace before having to go back to the slog of life.
  - position: 78
    title: This Guy's in Love with You
    artist: Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass
    year: "1968"
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Easy listening
    commentary: Another easy listening song, this one’s very similar to “Stranger on The Shore”, but this one’s got a bit of a pop swing to it. It’s also a bit of an outlier, as Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass were mainly an instrumental group, but here Alpert decided to do some vocals on the song… and why the hell did he stop here? At least on this track, his voice suits the laid-back nature of the song. Also, the way the orchestra builds up to each chorus is amazing, and Alpert’s trumpet solo in the middle is just the icing on the cake.
  - position: 77
    title: Ms. Jackson
    artist: Outkast
    year: "2001"
    genres:
      - Alternative hip hop
    commentary: "At a time when the likes of Usher and Sisqó were topping the charts with lame R&B, Outkast were rising as a formidable rap duo who were not afraid to break boundaries. Case in point: The reversed drum beat that acts as the foundation for the song. Throw in some tasteful synths and a funky bassline, and you got one hell of a beat. It’d be too easy to praise the catchy chorus, instead I’ll praise the lyrics instead. The song is directed towards his ex-girlfriend’s mother, with him apologizing for rushing into a relationship with her daughter that was never meant to be. I implore you to check out the lyrics if you ever get the chance; some solid writing skills, that’s for sure!"
  - position: 76
    title: Faith
    artist: George Michael
    year: 1987/88
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Rock & Roll
    commentary: This song is pretty much a tribute to Elvis Presley. Maybe it’s not in a direct sense, but it absolutely is in a spiritual sense, and George Michael knocks it out of the park. The mix of the Bo Diddley rhythm, the ‘80s drum machines, and the gated reverb effect on his vocals, it’s an outstanding synthesis of classic Rock N’ Roll and ‘80s pop sensibilities. It’s also got this killer country-western style guitar solo in the middle that may seem a bit out of place first listen, but almost instantly grows on you. An extremely well-produced, upbeat pop song at a time when producers were getting softer and lamer.
  - position: 75
    title: Everyday People
    artist: Sly & the Family Stone
    year: "1969"
    genres:
      - Psychedelic soul
    commentary: A nice little, short, and simple soul/funk song; it’s basically an anthem of world peace and unity. The steady bassline and drumbeat combined with some jazzy piano chords and some tasteful horns make for a soul staple. I like the use of the “nanna nanna boo boo” cadence on the bridge sections; it’s contrasted well with the lyrics about intolerance and being unaccepting. I wish I had a lot to gush about this song, but it’s really its simplicity that makes it great. Sometimes that’s all you need.
  - position: 74
    title: Hotel California
    artist: The Eagles
    year: "1977"
    genres:
      - Rock
      - Soft rock
    commentary: "An extremely well-composed rock number, I really didn’t rank it this high for of its catchy chorus or intriguing story. I ranked it this high for its legendary guitar work. Both Don Felder and Joe Walsh just go absolutely ham on this track, with some fantastic, dreamy desert chord progressions and an outro dual-guitar solo that is beyond legendary. In fact, Guitar World thought so too, and put it at #8 of their “greatest guitar solos of all-time” list in 2008. The way they both play off each other is amazing, it’s as if the devil and some prospective young guitarist are dueling at the crossroads."
  - position: 73
    title: One More Try
    artist: George Michael
    year: "1988"
    genres:
      - Soft rock
      - Blue-eyed soul
    commentary: Like “Faith”, this one is also a throwback song. This one however, is a throwback to the slow ballads of the ‘50s and once again, George Michael knocks it out of the park. His vocal control and range are just great on this somber song. The lyrics are also pretty tragic as well. The whole song’s lyrics are just one big “stay away from me, I’ve had my heart broken to many times to do this again, and I don’t want to feel that way anymore” but then on the very last line, he gives in and utters the phrase “…maybe just one more try…” sealing his fate to yet another doomed relationship.

    title: Walk Right In
    artist: The Rooftop Singers
    year: "1963"
    genres:
      - Progressive Folk
    commentary: "This was a MASSIVE breath of fresh air in a year of some of the most bland and boring doo-wop. This is one hell of a spunky folk song! The timbre of two guys strumming on two 12-string acoustic guitars is just phenomenal. My favorite part has to be the ascending and descending guitar licks during the instrumental in the middle, complete with time-signature changes all while still being danceable and catchy. Let’s also not leave out the very singable lyrics: “walk right in, sit right down, daddy let your mind roll on!”"

    artist: Pink Floyd
    year: "1980"
    genres:
      - Progressive rock
      - Disco
    commentary: "I really wanted to place this one higher, but ultimately decided to place it here, because the song on its own, removed from its original context, is really do it an injustice. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a legendary song and I’m happy that Pink Floyd, these weirdo, arsty, prog rockers, scored themselves a #1 hit, but it’s an incomplete song. If you’ve never sat down and listened to “The Wall”, the album this song is from, I think you ‘ought to. The whole album is like one big story where each song plays into the next, and it’s just great. Once I listened to the album front to back, I could never listen to each song on its own again. It would be like watching a single scene from a movie and ending it there."

    artist: Bobby McFerrin
    year: "1988"
    genres:
      - Reggae
      - Jazz
      - A cappella
    commentary: Unlike the song above, I actually wanted to put this song much lower. However, I must admire just how genuine and sincere this song is. The whole song is just one big a cappella with each section recorded by McFerrin. Like… literally that’s it, no instruments, just his voice doing the melody and bass and some light clapping and snapping for percussion. That might not mean much, as I’m sure there are plenty of bad a cappella songs out there, but this one’s not. The composition is essentially perfect in reflecting the emotion of pure joy and innocence; no wonder it became smash hit in 1988!

    title: Irreplaceable
    artist: Beyoncé
    year: 2006/07
    genres:
      - Pop
      - R&B
    commentary: Beyoncé at her best; one of the best vocal performances of the ‘00s. Written by Ne-Yo and given to Beyoncé, she really puts her heart into this one. Great control, range, and some genuinely clever and funny lyrics. “To the left, to the left” sounds like it would be a dance move, but then you hear “everything you own, in the box to the left” followed by some of the most savage “get out of my house” lyrics ever written. Finally, the open chords being played on the acoustic guitar are amazing; hearing those note ring out makes you feel like you’re soaring up in the clouds.

    title: Sunshine on My Shoulders
    artist: John Denver
    year: "1974"
    genres:
      - Folk
    commentary: "Easily John Denver’s best song, in my opinion. Sometimes, it’s not about big your song sounds, but instead about how genuine and sincere you sound, and that’s exactly what Devner does here. People tend to say “Rocky Mountain High” is his signature outdoorsman song, but this song is actually about the great outdoors. He wrote it while watching a rising sun on a groggy morning in Minnesota, and what we got is a simple folk song with a few simple chords and a heartfelt vocal performance by Denver. These lyrics are genuinely beautiful: “If I had a day that I could give you, I’d give to you a day just like today... If I had a song that I could sing for you, I’d a sing a song to make you feel this way… Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy.”"

    commentary: "No, it’s not THOSE Highwaymen. This was a short-lived folk group from the early ‘60s that I don’t think most people know about. This simple, swingy, folk song is not just a folk song. It’s an old African-American spiritual that was written in the 1860s by former slaves of the island of St. Helena, off the coast of South Carolina. See, it’s actually the oldest song to hit #1 if you think about it. However, it’s not its historicity that makes it good, it’s its performance. The softly strummed guitar chords, the somber whistling, the soft demeanor of the voices In the group, and the absolutely angelic harmonies with those biblical lyrics combine to make an emotional experience for the listener. If you want to hear another legendary performance of this song, folk singer Pete Seeger sings his own version that does it justice as well."

      - Acid rock
      - Psychedelic pop
      - Avant-pop
      - R&B
    commentary: "The magnum opus of Brian Wilson’s Beach Boys, the writing, composition, recording, and mixing of this song is something that can fill textbooks but let’s just say that Brian Wilson succeeded in his quest to write the greatest pop song of his day. There’s plenty of documentaries and biopics to pick from if you’d like to learn more about it, so I’ll just leave it at this: listen to this song!"

    artist: Guns N' Roses
    year: "1988"
    genres:
      - Hard rock
      - Glam metal
    commentary: I have a confession to make… I don’t like Guns N’ Roses that much. I can appreciate the talent of everyone in the group and their mark on rock history, but I just can’t get into their stuff. However, this is where songwriting and legacy take precedent for my placing of this song here. It really is just a well-made and composed song. Also, it was a breath of fresh air hearing this during a year of tacky, edgeless synth pop. The main guitar riff is catchy and melodic, the lyrics are nice, and the way the band plays off each other is just fantastic… oh yeah and I guess the outro is one of the most badass things I’ve ever heard as well. No seriously, Slash’s absolutely bonkers guitar solo towards the end easily knocked this song way up the rankings for me.

    title: I Want to Know What Love Is
    artist: Foreigner
    year: "1985"
    genres:
      - Soft rock
    commentary: "Foreigner’s only #1 hit in their career, and a personal favorite for me. They may have been a hard rock band first and foremost, but damn could they write a ballad! The soft and subtle synths combined with that steady drum beat and Lou Gramm’s vulnerable vocal performance are perfection. Of course, the song’s build up to those huge angelic choir choruses are the main attraction; it really sends this song into the clouds if you ask me. Also the backing vocals by Jennifer Holiday towards the ends are pretty good too!"

    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1969"
    genres:
      - Blues rock
      - Swamp Rock / Rock
      - Pop
    commentary: "The last double single to be featured on the list, here we have two of the most legendary Beatles songs ever written. “Come Together” is a down-and-dirty blue rock number with a commanding vocal performance by John Lennon and some of the most tasteful guitar work of George Harrison’s career. It’s truly a song to define the Vietnam War era of music. “Something” on the other hand is a sincere and vulnerable love song written and performed by Harrison. The softly played chords on the electric guitar with the occasional slide guitar licks and the shaky lyrics about the uncertainty of his commitment make for a great love song. One last thing to praise is how easily Harrison blends the melodies together: so seamless."

    title: Volare (Nel blu dipinto di blu)
    artist: Domenico Modugno
    year: "1958"
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: "The most senior of the #1 hits on this list, this was the third #1 hit ever in the U.S. (going off the 1958 start year for the Hot 100 list). This humble Italian man with a simple knack for making catchy songs somehow managed to sing his way into the hearts of us Americans and score the only #1 hit of his career and the only #1 hit to have been sung in Italian. So, is it any good? Of course! What I love about it is it’s quiet-loud dynamic. He starts the song off slow and simple but picks up the pace during the chorus and then slows it back down during the next verse; it gives the song a humble, care-free spirit feel! Not to mention, Modugno’s fantastic vocal performance. He can really hit those high notes and his cutesy, bouncy cadence during the “Nel blu… dipinto di blu” parts are so wholesome that it’ll make you smile."

    title: Down Under
    artist: Men At Work
    year: "1983"
    genres:
      - Pop rock
    commentary: I’m convinced that this song will become Australia’s national anthem within 100 years. This is just a fun-ass song to listen to, certain to bring your spirits up for sure. These guys almost certainly wrote this as a silly, tongue-in-cheek song, but they inadvertently wrote a song that captures the heart and soul of our Aussie brothers and sisters way… well, down under. The use of vignettes for each verse were a great creative decision, as each one is like a little slice-of-life (although very metaphorical in its content) of the bandmates. Instrumentally, the use of flutes and twangy, reverberated guitars are great, and put the listener into the soundscape of Australia very well.

    title: Red Red Wine
    artist: UB40
    year: "1988"
    genres:
      - Reggae fusion
    commentary: This one’s a personal favorite of mine; a song originally done by Neil Diamond, UB-40 throws a reggae/ska feel onto it and it gives the song a life it didn’t have before. For the most part, it really is just a simple, straight-forward cover, but I think they do a good job of retaining the soul of the song with this transition. Not to mention Ali Campell’s great vocal performance, it’s just a well-composed cover, through-in-through.

    title: This Is How We Do It
    artist: Montell Jordan
    year: "1995"
    genres:
      - New jack swing
      - Hip hop
      - Soul
      - R&B
    commentary: THE party anthem of the ‘90s, it perfectly synthesizes the new jack swing sound of the early ‘90s with the golden-age hip hop of the mid-90s. A nice bridge between the smooth R&B of the likes of Boyz II Men with the gritty hip hop of the likes of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. However, even with the lyrical content sounding like it’s something Coolio would have wrote, it’s still family-friendly for radio play, and Montell Jordan’s smooth delivery is the icing on the cake. Let’s also not ignore the immaculate production quality; solid beat and piano-driven chord progression and the “this is how we do it!” refrain is too damn catchy to not sing.
  - position: 58
    title: Say It Right
    artist: Nelly Furtado
    year: "2007"
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: "The best #1 hit of Timbaland’s career as a producer and easily Nelly Furtado’s best song. The entire song has this ethereal reverb effect that washes over the whole song and gives it this ghostly feel to it. Nelly Furtado’s haunting vocals and Timbaland’s distant-sounding adlibs really sell the feel of the song well. However, even with the indie-popish production, it remains very catchy with the drumline beat and singable chorus. To top it all off, the song fades out with an extremely tasteful electric guitar solo, sealing the deal on this song as one of the best of the ‘00s."

    title: Sleepwalk
    artist: Santo & Johnny
    year: "1959"
    genres:
      - Instrumental rock
      - Surf rock
    commentary: If one song could personify the act of sitting in a diner in the ‘50s drinking chocolate malts with your high school sweetheart, this would probably be the best candidate. However, the slow, swingy, ‘50s chord progression isn’t the only thing that defines this song. Never have I heard an instrumental with so much heart and soul poured into it; the combination of the steady electric guitar on rhythm and the tasteful steel pedal on lead makes for a sound that so full of emotion, you can feel it in your bones. The last few chords on electric guitar that finish the song are just so perfect; amazing instrumental work.

    artist: TLC
    year: "1995"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Hip hop
      - Soul
    commentary: "The song that was #1 in the country the week I was born, and I’m not complaining. This soulful R&B song is quite hard to listen to, as it tackles some sad topics. The first verse describing the murder of a young teen selling drugs and the second verse the death of young man from AIDs; all of these stories are tied off with the soaring chorus “Don’t go chasing waterfalls, please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you’re used to, I know you’re gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you’re moving to fast.” It’s quite an emotional listen and the use of a steady drumbeat, slinky funk guitar, and dreamy electric organs really capture the emotion of the song very well. Not to mention’s Left-Eye’s amazing rap verse that ends the song on a hopeful message “Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you”."

    title: Another One Bites The Dust
    artist: Queen
    year: "1980"
    genres:
      - Funk rock
      - Disco
    commentary: I always love it when a band that usually sticks to one genre goes outside of their comfort zone to give us a banger in a completely different one. Queen were operatic rockers; they wrote these massive, epic songs with stories that were more of a fit for an opera/stage play and not a rock concert. However, In 1980, Queen busted out this hard rock number built around a simple, badass bassline and they knocked it right out of the park. Freddie Mercury’s commanding vocal performance, Brian May’s funky guitar lead, and Roger Taylor’s steady 4-on-the-floor beat compliment Jon Deacon’s bassline so well. It’s when a band comes together and uses their strengths that we get songs like this.

    title: More Than Words
    artist: Extreme
    year: "1991"
    genres:
      - Soft rock
      - Acoustic rock
    commentary: "One of the last hair ‘80s metal ballads to reach #1, Extreme, a band that usually is at-home writing hyper-complicated speed metal songs with sweep-picked guitar solos, slows it down to a simple acoustic love song, and it’s just amazing. The soulful guitar chords combined with the amazing vocal harmonies by Gary Cherone and Nuno Bettencourt are just perfect here; another case of a group doing a song outside of their wheelhouse and nailing it. However, them being speed metalheads, they couldn’t help themselves. Right at the end of the song, we get an honest-to-God tapped and sweep-picked acoustic guitar solo by Bettencourt and to be frank, it’s fantastic. A song that has aged well in a genre that really hasn’t."

    title: Human
    artist: The Human League
    year: "1986"
    genres:
      - Synth-pop
      - Pop
      - Soul
    commentary: The magnum-opus of both The Human League and producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. This is the synthpop song to end all synthpop songs. Really, the reason why I placed this one so high is because of the synths themselves. They carry this song like how Atlas carries the Earth. The staggard, snappy percussion, the wash of twinkly keys and bass synths give the song a timbre that is truly unmatched, especially in the last 30 seconds of the song, it’s almost as if God composed it, it’s that good! It’s also worth mentioning Phillip Oakley and Joanne Catherall’s outstanding vocal performances; they play off each other so well here. It’s a shame that their careers plummeted shortly after the success of this record.

    title: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For
    artist: U2
    year: "1987"
    genres:
      - Rock
      - Gospel
    commentary: "A song to lift one’s spirits up, that’s for sure. It’s so happy sounding with the bouncing bassline and ethereal guitar work by The Edge. Lead singer Bono also gives an outstanding performance; matches the tone of the song very well and the harmonies provided by the rest of the band follow suit. The lyrical content of the song is also pretty good.  It appears to be about a man going through a crisis of self. After enduring all his trials and tribulations, he “still hasn’t found what he’s looking for”. It can be interpreted in a many of ways, but my interpretation is quite hopeful: I think ultimately, we’re not supposed to find what we are looking for, but instead it’s what we need the most that finds us."

    title: Mr. Tambourine Man
    artist: The Byrds
    year: "1965"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Jangle pop
    commentary: "The one and only song written by Bob Dylan to reach #1, The Byrds bring us one of the best covers to come from the British Invasion era of rock (which is funny, because The Byrds were American). The somber vocal performances and harmonies provided by the band combined with those heavenly 12-string Rickenbacker guitars really put you in the headspace of America in the mid-60s. I think it’s also worth mentioning that during this time, many of the Beatles considered The Byrds to be the best band from America. It just goes to show you how talent can appreciate other talent. However, even this song is a far-cry in quality to the one other #1 hit, which we’ll be getting to much later (hint, hint, wink, wink)."

    title: I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    year: "1982"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Pop
      - Soft rock
    commentary: Never has a Roland drum machine sounded so good! If I had to pick one song to be the ambassador of the drum machine as an instrument, THIS would be the song I’d elect. Hall & Oates were masters of their craft, and they embraced the ‘80s sound with open arms. The drum beat and bassline for this song go soooo hard, it’s not even funny. Take some tasteful synth stabs and runs and Daryl Hall’s buttery smooth vocals and you got yourself a hit to last the ages. During the recording of the star-powered charity single “We Are The World” in 1985, Michael Jackson walked up to Hall & Oates and personally thanked them for “letting him steal the bassline from ‘I Can’t Go For That’ for his song ‘Billie Jean’”. See, even MJ knew this was an instant classic and used it as inspiration for writing his own magnum-opus… oh yeah, and the saxophone solo by Charles DeChant is the greatest of all-time in pop music, nothing too special.

    year: "1965"
    genres:
      - Pop
      - R&B
      - Blue-eyed soul
    commentary: Easily one of the best traditional pop songs of the ‘60s. What catapulted this song so high up the rankings for me are the vocal performances by Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield (Yes, believe it or not, they are not actually brothers). Medley’s bass-baritone and Hatfield’s Soprano-Tenor voices were a match made in heaven; one of the best vocal duos of all-time. The bridge section of this songs is what sends this song into the stratosphere. The call-response “Baby! Baby!” between the two with the symphonic build-up to the chorus is the stuff of legends.

    title: Paint It, Black
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    year: "1966"
    genres:
      - Raga rock
      - Psychedelic rock
    commentary: "I still can’t believe this song was written in 1966, let alone it being a #1 hit! The Rolling Stones were always the more edgy band to come from the British Invasion, but this dark and moody song they wrote in the middle of that movement is something that sounds like it could have been written in the ‘90s. During a time when most pop was still very bright and cheery, we get a song with lyrics about a man mourning the loss of his lover by picturing the whole world turning black. However, is it a good song on its own? Absolutely! The main riff performed by Keith Richards on the sitar adds a lot of moody timbre to the song and Charlie Watts pounding rhythm on the drums gives the song a primitive feel. The hummed outro is so well-done, you can’t help but hum along."

    title: Let's Dance
    artist: David Bowie
    year: "1983"

      - Funk
      - New wave
      - Dance-rock
      - Post-disco
      - Dance-pop
      - Funk rock
    commentary: One of the best dance numbers of the ‘80s, by the man himself David Bowie. Considering Bowie’s artsy roots as a glam rocker, seeing him become a staple of the ‘80s pop movement was probably a shock to some. However, his eclectic tastes and talents basically guaranteed at least one hit from him during this era, and what we got was amazing. The funk on this track is undeniable, and Bowie gives us a vocal performance of a lifetime. The “under the moonlight, the serious moonlight” line is so damn good, as well as the rest of the lyrics. Of course, it would be a crime to not acknowledge the banger guitar work by Stevie Ray Vaughn on this song. Even Bowie could recognize talent beyond the genre he was working on and brought one of the best blues guitarists to ever live aboard to give this song its finishing touches.

    title: Take On Me
    artist: a-ha
    year: "1985"
    genres:
      - Synth-pop
      - New wave
    commentary: Okay, THIS is the synthpop song to end all synthpop songs. Never have synths sounded so good and catchy. The main synthline is so damn good; the driving drum machines, and snappy basslines also add so much to this song. It’d be hard to ignore the fantastic vocal performance by Morten Harket; his voice suits the song very well, and the rising vocal line during the chorus is quite an impressive feat for any singer. My favorite part is easily the breakdown in the middle with those twinkly rising-and-falling chromatic scales played on the synths; just compositional bliss. You know, there was a lot of low-tier garbage that came from this genre… but these unsuspecting Norwegian new wavers came along in 1985 to set the standard for what makes a good synthpop song and now, it’s a timeless classic.

    title: One Sweet Day
    artist: Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men
    year: 1995/96
    genres:
      - R&B
    commentary: "Although I have it ranked at #45, I will admit that this is probably the closest we are getting to the “perfect” pop song. The story behind this one is something out of a storybook. Mariah Carey was writing a song to celebrate the life of longtime friend and producer David Cole who died of AIDs in January 1995. She was already planning on collaborating with Boyz II Men, and the day they found themselves in the studio together, she showed them the chorus to this song. They were taken aback; it turns out they were writing basically the same song with a similar feel and lyrics. It was at this point they knew they had a hit on their hands and threw the kitchen sink at this one. What we got were the best performances of their careers, and a #1 hit that stayed at the top for 16 consecutive weeks. The slow, contemplative verses combined with the soaring and emotional choruses sound like something an angel would write. That feels like an appropriate descriptor, considering the gospel-like lyrical content."

    title: My Prerogative
    artist: Bobby Brown
    year: "1989"
    genres:
      - New jack swing
    commentary: "The song that put new jack swing on the map, and a damn good ambassador of what a good new jack swing song sounds like. The snappy rhythm section, the swingy synths, the orchestral stabs, and Bobby Brown’s commanding presence over the song make this one of the funkiest songs of the late ‘80s. This was a much needed #1 hit, as most of the songs at this time were just slow, boring, and edgeless. I love the lyrical content of this song, it’s so in-your-face. It’s like… why do you care about what I do with my time and money? How about you go get bent and let me live the way I want to? Huh?!” The singable chorus really hammers this message home, and I love it."

    title: Stronger
    artist: Kanye West
    year: "2007"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Electronica
    commentary: Let’s get this out of the way. This is probably one of the best samples ever used in a hip hop song. Kanye West’s decision to sample Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” was genius, and the down-tuned chorus combined with those pounding rhythms gives the listener the strength to charge into battle, no matter the odds of survival. This is also probably one of the best if not the best performance by West as well, he really commands this song and that chorus is soooo damn good. I remember watching a mini-documentary about the album this song is on, “Graduation” being the turning point where the “crunk” era was replaced by style of Kanye West as the king of hip hop. So I guess I have this song to thank for ending the rein of a sub-genre that I just don’t like that much.

    year: "1996"
    genres:
      - R&B
      - Hip hop
      - New jack swing
    commentary: "Speaking of bad-ass hip hop, this song is THE epitome of badassery. No hip hop song (or at least no #1 hip hop song) makes the listener feel like a badass like this song. I think what makes this song so legendary is the immaculate production quality done by Dr. Dre. The snappy 4/4 rhythm, the sampling of “Grandma’s Hands” by Bill Withers, and those pounding piano bass notes at the end of each bar give the song a grit that sets it apart from the rest. Let’s talk about the verses. Every. Single. Verse. Is perfect. Dr. Dre’s commanding rap intro, Teddy Riley’s verse with those smooth vocals, Chauncey Hannibal’s nasally voice on the second verse, and Queen Pen’s closing verse is equally commanding as Dr. Dre’s. The harmonies on the chorus and the “hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-ooooohh” refrain is too catchy to not sing. If you’re a fan of the old soul of the ‘60s but never saw the appeal of hip hop, then I think this is the song that will turn you on it. A masterpiece of the genre."

    artist: The Animals
    year: "1964"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Blues rock
      - Proto-prog
    commentary: This song is quite a mystery. We have no clue who wrote it or where it came from. Some musicologist date the origins of this song back to 16th century England, with the earliest recording being from Appalachia in the 1930s. However, there is no denying that this song was done best by The Animals. They did what could be considered the impossible and took an old folk song and gave it the British Invasion treatment and made a rock number to last the ages. Everything about this song is just amazing. The arpeggiated guitar riff, Eric Burton’s powerful vocal performance (which was something new to pop music), and an absolutely legendary electric organ performance by Alan Price. He goes complete apeshit on this song, it’s so damn good. The way the song builds up in sound and timbre makes it sound like some proto metal song, and the final extended chord played on the organ finishes the song with a bang… oh yeah, this was in 1964 by the way. People were still getting used to The Beatles and here were The Animals making a song so huge in scope that it probably put people on their asses the first time they heard it.

    title: Hello
    artist: Adele
    year: 2015/16
    genres:
      - Soul
    commentary: Adele’s magnum opus. It’s like she took the best qualities of her previous hits and filtered them into one perfect Adele song. Easily one of the best piano chord progressions I’ve ever heard. It’s so somber and emotional, it perfectly suits Adele’s soft and vulnerable vocals during the verses as well as her powerful and soulful cries for help during the choruses. It’s insane to think about how much effort she poured into this song; it’s so simple in its composition, and yet so epic sounding; Top-notch production quality, that’s for sure.

    title: You Haven't Done Nothin'
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    year: "1974"
    genres:
      - Funk
    commentary: "My favorite Stevie Wonder song and probably the single most explicitly political song to reach #1; this one’s a scathing critique of President Richard Nixon, who ironically resigned just two days after the release of this song. Coincidence? Maybe. However, it’s political message is NOT the reason why I ranked this song so high. It’s because it’s an absolute funk overload, that’s why! This is easily his most funky song he’s ever written. The simple broomstick rhythm is paired well with a very percussive clavinet riff played by Wonder, and the horns that pop in and out of the song compliment the composition well. Let’s also not ignore the extremely catchy “doo da wop!” refrain provided by the Jackson 5 after each chorus."

    artist: Arthra Franklin
    year: "1967"
    genres:
      - Soul
    commentary: "When I was listening to the R&B #1 hits of the ‘60s, I was surprised how little edge each hit had… and then I got to this one. Like, I can’t tell you how much more power and soul this song has over anything The Supremes ever did, or any of the other ‘60s R&B songs I had to listen to for this project, and to be frank, I don’t think I every heard a song to match the commanding presence Aretha Franklin has over this song. Throw in a tasteful tenor sax solo by Curtis Ousley and some outstanding backing vocals by her sisters, and you got one hell of a soul song."

      - R&B
      - Funk
    commentary: Bruno Mars and company do the impossible on this song, writing and composing what I think is the best ‘90s-style R&B song every written. It’s so undeniably smooth in its delivery, and combined with that top-notch 21st century production quality, it puts everything from the decade it’s honoring to shame. I could go into detail about all of the tasteful callbacks to the acts of the ‘90s or the clever lyrics, but instead I’ll just implore you to listen to the song yourself and see what makes this one great.

    artist: Marvin Gaye
    year: 1968/69
    genres:
      - Soul
      - R&B
    commentary: "The single most badass sounding R&B #1 hit of the ‘60s. Marvin Gaye really gives it his all on this one, and it shows. Hardly anyone could match the passion he brought to his songs. The electric organ riff that acts as the backbone for this song sounds so metal, I would like to imagine that Black Sabbath probably listened to this song to death as inspiration for some of their songs. I also really like those soft backing vocals by The Andantes’, it’s almost as if they are gossiping on the other side of said grapevine, which is extremely fitting considering the lyrical content of the song. Sometimes even a simple song like this one can tell a story and be an experience in of itself."

    genres:
      - Art pop
      - Electropop
    commentary: "A sleeper hit from 2013, this artsy indie pop song is really the perfect case study of how to make a minimal-sounding pop song. A basic bassline with some occasional synths, a simple drum machine beat, throw some reverb over everything, and let Lorde’s voice carry the rest of the song and boy does her voice carry this song. Despite being only 16 years old at the time of recording, her voice is so rich in it’s sound and timbre, that she sounds like an elder soul singer with many years of experience. Another great thing about this song is the lyrics. They are so tongue-in-cheek and yet clever in its message: “But every song’s like: ‘Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin’ in the bathroom, Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin’ the hotel room’, We don’t care, we’re driving Cadillacs in our dreams” It’s like she’s mocking the materialistic lyrics of modern pop while wishing she could enjoy the same things without the implication of being materialistic. Some real “between a rock and a hard place” stuff."

    commentary: “Here lies Phillip J. Fry… named after his uncle… to carry on his spirit.” If you get this reference, then you may start to get teary-eyed. That’s the power this song has on people. This seemingly “simple” new wave, pop rock song is much more than just a feel-good summer hit used in the film “The Breakfast Club”, it’s a testament to spirit and emotion of the ‘80s. The “don’t you forget about me” refrain during the chorus is almost like the ‘80s decade itself is calling out to us; to get us to remember the magic of the decade. If I had to pick one song as the ambassador of the ’80s, I’d be this one hands down.

    artist: Dire Straits
    year: "1985"
    genres:
      - Pop rock
    commentary: "There’s a spectacular irony in the message of this song. The lyrics are all about some blue-collar workers complaining that they have to bust their ass to make a living while these MTV rock stars are getting “money for nothing”. This of course, is coming from the pen of a band that helped define the ‘80s MTV generation. However, this is more of a friendly ribbing towards Dire Straits because no amount of irony can tear down the banger of a rock track this song is. The soft, contemplative synth intro with Sting singing those angelic lyrics “I want my MTV”; this all builds up, with a drum solo and all, to one of the most badass guitar riffs ever composed. Nothing gets my hyped up more than hearing that riff get blasted through my speakers. However, once the song reaches this climax, it stays there for the remainder of the song with a perfect blend of blue rock and synthpop to carry us to the end with Sting coming back with those lyrics: “I want my MTV”."

    commentary: "The single best crossover hit of recent memory, appealing to hip hop fans, R&B fans, pop fans, rock fans, electronic fans, the whole gamut. However, don’t let that fool you. The breadth of appeal this song does not take away from the depth this song has. The countdown intro rockets quickly into the catchy hook of the song with an acoustic guitar driving it. The use of only major chords (the “happy” sounding ones) for the main riff, the upbeat drumbeat, and the catchy “Hey, ya!” refrain is completely contrasted by the down-right depressing lyrical content of the song. I mean, just take the second verse: “You think you've got it, but ‘got it’ just don't get it till there's nothing at all. We get together, but separate's always better when there's feelings involved. If what they say is, ‘Nothing is forever’ Then what makes love the exception? So why are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here? Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance…” I think that last line really says it all."

    year: "1987"
    genres:
      - Rock
    commentary: One of the most cliché tropes of pop music is the use of the “4 chords” progression. You might not know what this is, but if you look it up on YouTube, you’ll immediately recognize it. It’s usually viewed as a cheap way to write a pop song, but when it’s done right, it can make a song sound legendary. Bono and company did exactly that when they made this song. This is the single best use of the “4 chords” I’ve ever heard. It suits the contemplative and depressing feel of the song so well. The way the song builds up in sound, with Bono starting us off with a simple spoken word verse which leads into him belting out the chorus, and the fantastic intro of The Edge on guitar with that ethereal and legendary delay pedal riff. The song continues to build up in sound until it climaxes with the soaring vocals of Bono on the final chorus. The song closes us off with The Edge giving us a simple and yet emotional guitar coda that mirrors the “4 chords” the song is built around.

    commentary: "The hardest rockin’ song to ever reach #1, and it will probably never be topped. This is hands-down my favorite instrumental #1 hit, and I still can’t believe this was a #1 hit. It’s like America just decided one day that they like heavy metal enough to send this proggy instrumental to the top of the charts. This song is like one big exercise of technical mastery; just when you think the song is slowing down, Edgar Winter throws in another damn instrument to shred on. First, it’s the guitar work by Ronnie Montrose, then it’s the keyboards by Edgar Winter, and then we get a damn saxophone solo by Winter, and then it evolves into an honest-to-God drum battle between Chuck Ruff on the kit and Winter on the timbales, AND THEN ANOTHER keyboard solo by Winter, AND THEN FINALLY a chaotic breakdown by Winter on the ARP 2600 synthesizer. The band called the song “Frankenstein” because during the initial recording of the track, they had so many spliced tapes of each instrument just draped over tables and furniture that it was like assembling Frankenstein’s monster. However, this is not just some hyper-composed instrumental track that was made for the studio. If you go on YouTube, you can find a live performance of this song from a TV show, and no joke, they perform it NOTE FOR NOTE on all the previously mentioned instruments. Insane amount of talent from these guys!"

    commentary: Just when I was getting tired of listening to all the disco and slow, boring, piano ballads of the late ‘70s, The Knack comes along and blows everyone else out of the water with this hard rock number. The song starts us off with a thundering, primal drumbeat which leads into the massively catchy and powerful guitar riff that drives this song. I cannot put into words how badass the main guitar riff for this song is, just see for yourself. That’s not the only thing that’s great about the guitar in this song; there’s not one, but TWO guitar solos. The first one is punchy and hard; a nice addition to the driving power of the main riff and just when you think the song is coming to an end, the song changes key and what we get next is one of the greatest guitar solos of all-time by Berton Averre. The technically on display is one thing, but the solo fits the groove of the song so well. Easily my favorite one-hit wonder on all-time.

    genres:
      - R&B
    commentary: The best R&B group of the ‘90s, no one could match the unique, smooth timbre of the harmonies of Boyz II Men, and I think this was their best song from this era of music. The slow, waltz rhythm with the twinkly keys are the perfect supplement to each of the singer’s solo verses and the harmonies during the choruses are just… perfect. The vocal transition into each chorus by Wanya Morris is something of legends. Easily the best part of the song is the interlude with the whole group singing “Lonely… Lonely…” while Morris belts out the last line of the pre-chorus. I wish I had more to say about this song, but it’s really just an extremely well-made song with a simple, straight-forward song, and I think it’s its simplicity that makes it so great.

    commentary: This song has become sort of a meme amongst young folks, like how “Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Astley did, but I’m gonna sound like a total hipster and say that “I liked it before it became a meme”. This is a masterpiece of pop rock composition. It’s the perfect blend of the ‘70s rock sound and the newer synth pop of the ‘80s. The geographical topic of the song is manifested in a top-notch use of congas, marimbas, shakers, and a tasteful collection of synths. On top of that, we get a fantastic vocal performance by both David Paich during the verses and Bobby Kimball during the chorus. The lyrics are also quite well-written, with a bit of vagueness to give the listener the power to interpret it however they want. The harmonies during the last chorus are just out of this world and end the song on a powerful note.

    year: "2012"
    genres:
      - Art pop
    commentary: "This is another one of those “how the hell did this reach #1?” songs. It’s insane to think that this moody, artsy fartsy, indie pop breakup song at one point was the most popular song in the America. It’s surprisingly a simple song, with a minimal, shuffle rhythm with acoustic guitars and an honest-to-God xylophone riff. After the first verse, we get another addition to the basic rhythm with a marching snare and some simple, tasteful synths. However, this song goes from 0 to 100 quick when Gotye belts out that instantly catchy and powerful chorus; that alone sent this song way up the rankings for me. Then we get an amazing vocal performance by Kimbra on the last verse, giving her side of the story. The song is then wrapped up with another fantastic chorus with pitch-perfect harmonies by Kimbra to match Gotye’s lines. It’s almost like they are arguing and talking over each other in song form. It’s a shame that Gotye practically disappeared after this hit; it’s like he’s now… somebody that we used to know."

    commentary: THE magnum opus of ‘80s pop and easily MJ’s best song. Out of all of the songs on this list, this one has, hands-down, the best intro. The simple 4/4 drum rhythm with that tight snare drum, followed by the funky bassline and then followed by those softly stabbed synth lines is composition perfection. Of course, Jackson’s vocal performance is what carries this song into legendary status. Combined with his iconic ad-libs, Jackson’s vulnerable and somber vocals are tinged with a vibrato that is unmatched. That’s just the verses; when the pre-chorus and chorus come up, Jackson’s belting performance wakes us all up and ups-the-ante that this groove is rolling. Throw in a banger of a funk guitar solo in the middle and the “Billie Jean is not my lover!” refrain throughout, and you got one of the best pop songs of the ‘80s.

    year: "1986"
    genres:
      - Rock
      - Soft Rock
    commentary: "A song with a political message; this song is about the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with each verse being a microcosm of the attitudes of the day. “Standin' in line, marking time, waiting for the welfare dime… 'cause they can't buy a job. The man in the silk suit hurries by as he catches the poor old lady's eyes. Just for fun, he says: ‘Get a job’” The somber stories are contrasted by the hopeful message of “don’t believe them” when they say “that’s just the way it is”. I haven’t even gotten to the composition of the song. The driving drum beat with the synthy bassline, matching guitar lines and the piano on this song… oh my, the piano on this song… no #1 hit rocks as hard as this one does on the piano. I put this song so high up on the list solely because of the virtuoso-level performance by Bruce Hornsby. From the main line to the somber descending riff during the chorus, to the amazing solo in the middle, he really gives his 110% on this one, and I don’t think there will ever be a #1 hit to match the piano skills of this song."

    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Afrobeat
      - Trap
    commentary: "What I love most about this song is how much of a “bait-and-switch” it is. The catchy afrobeat intro brings you in with its laid back and happy sound, and then “bam!” it’s all killed off with a single gunshot, a hypnotic, oscillating bassline, and the line sung by Donald Glover: “This is America… don’t catch you slippin’ now.” This is another explicitly political song. This one covers everything from police brutality, mass shootings, race relations, etc. all with a simple, trap rap, flow by Glover. It does bring back the afrobeat in the second verse, but once again it is killed off by gunshots and the line: “This is America… don’t catch you slippin’ now.” However, the two sounds blend on the last verse to tie the whole song together, and perhaps leave the song on a positive note. However, the erratic kick drum pattern and shrill synth line that fades the song out indicate to the listener that there are still problems in America to fix. I can’t help but love a song that is this provocative."

    artist: Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories
    year: "1994"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Pop rock
    commentary: "This song has an interesting story. Lisa Loeb was just like many aspiring acoustic folk artists living in New York City, and then a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity fell into her lap. Her neighbor, actor Ethan Hawke, was in the middle of making the rom-com film “Reality Bites” when he suggested to her to record one of her songs for the film’s soundtrack. At this time, she wasn’t even signed to a record label, but she went through with it, and it became an instant hit and is the only folk-rock song to hit #1 in the ‘90s, right in between #1 hits from All-4-One and Boyz II Men. However, Is it any good? It absolutely is. The main, ascending riff on the acoustic guitar is so hopeful in its sound, it’s can inspire. It really kicks into gear when the laid-back rhythm on the drum kit and those slinky strummed chords come in. Loeb’s vocals are also on-point. She sings with complete vulnerability raising her voice occasionally; it really suits the lyrical content about her wrestling with her feelings of regret and wanting her lover to “stay”. The whole song is actually quite unique in it’s composition, as there is no “verse-chorus-bridge” structure, it just sort of continuously rising in intensity until it ends with the ascending guitar riff and the somber line “You say… I only hear what I want to.”"

    year: "1985"
    genres:
      - New wave
      - Synth-pop
    commentary: My favorite pop act of the ‘80s, these guys were more than just catchy songwriters. They were though-provoking; they were intellectual, and this song is the perfect synthesis of ‘80s synthpop and high-minded poetry. The abstract lyrics tackle the feeling of power and how much people want it and how it can hurt others… all while we listen to a colorful collage of synths that wash over us with the warmth of a fireplace. The hummed intro with that guitar riff and the way it flows into the shuffled drum machine beat and the contemplative main synth line is amazing, and the chorus is infectiously catchy. The instrumental break before the first guitar solo with the hummed vocals give me goosebumps every time I listen to it. Both guitar solos complement the synths so well that it almost makes you forget that this is a song laced with imagery of the fear of Cold War nuclear annihilation. In fact, during the first gulf war, this song was banned on British radio stations as to not demoralize the troops with its political themes. Funny… this is the one song I think of the most when I think of the first gulf war. Strange how that happens.

    artist: The Byrds
    year: "1965"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
      - Jangle pop
    commentary: "My favorite song to come from the British Invasion era of rock, which is funny since The Byrds are American. At one point, the Beatles thought they were the best band to come from America, so I guess they have they’re blessing. What to say about this song? Oh, so much! For its origins, it’s probably the oldest song to reach #1, as the lyrics to this song are ripped straight from the King James Bible, Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, with some re-wording and creative liberties taken here and there. The composition itself was done by Folk artist Pete Seeger, and with his blessing, allowed The Byrds to record their own version and what we got was easily one of the best folk-rock songs ever recorded. It’s a case of the perfect song at the right time: In 1965, America was going through some hard times. The Vietnam War had just started, The Civil Rights movement was in full swing, and Cold War tensions were very high. This song, with its somber tone and distinct sound was the perfect reflection of the feelings many Americans had at this time. “A time of love, a time of hate, A time of war, a time of peace… a time you may embrace, a time to refrain from embracing.” A lot of people tend to think of this song as “one of those songs you hear in a movie when a scene takes place in the ‘60s”, but it is so much more than that. Case in point: the guitar on this song. As a guitarist, I wish I could put into words how amazing the Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar sounds. Despite the implication, the guitar is actually played like a standard 6-string guitar, but has a second, thinner string closely strung next to each of the standard strings. Those thinner strings are tuned to the exact pitch of the string it’s paired with but because it’s thinner, it gives you a different timbre and when played together, it gives you an amazing “jangly” sound. The “jangle” sound on this song is unmatched in my opinion, especially during the instrumental break in the middle; the wash of multiple Rickenbackers playing at once really captures the somber feeling of the song, like a time capsule from the 1965. I implore you folks to revisit this song and take a good listen: this is a masterpiece of folk rock."

    title: Another Day in Paradise
    artist: Phil Collins
    year: 1989/90
    genres:
      - Pop
    commentary: "Phil Collins has always been one of favorite solo pop artists, mainly due to the fact that he was the original drummer from the prog rock band Genesis and their lead singer after Peter Gabriel left in 1974. I always thought that his solo act songs were a nice combination of Prog Rock aesthetic and Pop sensibilities, even if he leaned more into the pop side of things. Some heads will write off this era of Collins and ‘80s Genesis as “bad” and a “betrayal” to their original catalogue but I always though their embrace of the ‘80s sound to be pretty graceful and tasteful. Many of his Collins’ hits were good, but nothing can match the immaculate composition of this song from the tail-end of his pop stardom. This song comes from his 1989 album “…But Seriously”, named so due to the much more “serious” topics being tackled in its lyrical content compared to his poppy-er, catchier, albums from before. This song in particular tackles the issue of homelessness. The whole song’s composition is eerily fitting for the topic at hand, with the intro made up of ominous synths and various instruments to set the tone, followed by some light guitar motifs and Collins’ iconic gated reverb snare drum. This all leads into the main groove of the song, made up of a simple drum beat and synth/guitar line that oozes the smooth feel of the R&B of the time. The restricted synth line and guitar motifs come back during the verses, which pairs well with the lyrics of the song: “You can tell from the lines on her face, you can see that she's been there. Probably been moved on from every place, 'cause she didn't fit in there.” Another thing I didn’t know before this project was that David Crosby provided backing vocals on this song, which is just cool. This song was a very strong way to end the ‘80s decade of music and a very strong way to usher in the ‘90s for pop. ‘Tis a shame that Phil Collins couldn’t carry on that success into the new decade."

    commentary: "An unsuspecting hit for 1984, but nonetheless a massive breakout success for Prince. At this point, he was already an established force behind the “Minneapolis Sound” movement, but this is when he got HUGE. This wasn’t just a #1 hit, but also the most successful #1 hit of 1984, topping the year-end chart for that year. Did he deserve the success? Absolutely. This is easily one of the most catchy and danceable hits of the ‘80s, and he managed to pull that off without using any bass at all. Seriously, this is probably the catchiest you can get without any low-end, and I doubt any artist will be able to top this song with the same formula. This song is really the embodiment of the old phrase: “less is more”. That if you compose the instrumentation the right way, you won’t even need more than two or three instruments. However, I am heavily biased in putting this song so high up the rankings because it has one of the most banger intros for a song I’ve ever heard. The song hits you like a Mac truck right out of the gate with an amazing, distorted guitar solo – a barrage of shred guitar combined with the undeniably catchy drum machine hook. This is then followed by Prince’s guttural, vocally fried “yeah… yeah… yeah… yeah…” which leads into the song’s main synth line. The rest of the song is quite literally just the drum machine and Prince’s vocals, with only the synths coming back during the pre-chorus and chorus – “less is more”. The lyrics have a neat juxtaposition of being very seductive in nature while also being ominously vague: “Dream, if you can, a courtyard, an ocean of violets in bloom. Animals strike curious poses; they feel the heat… the heat between me and you.” However, the song does rise in tension and power during the last chorus with Prince belting out an amazing vocal run with those rising synths behind it. A fantastic way to end the song… or so it would seem. Many people have only ever heard the single version of this song, but if you listen to the album version, the song is extended by a SECOND banger shred guitar solo, an amazing vocal high-note by Prince, and a classical, baroque-style synth solo, along with the proper outro most people are familiar with. People tend to miss out on the best a song has to offer, because radio stations only want to play songs that are short and quick. However, radio stations WILL play “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen which is 6 minutes long, but not the FULL version of this song which is also 6 minutes!? Give me a break…"

    commentary: |-
      Two Prince songs in a row? And in the top 20? Of course! After all, he was quite the songwriter. Yes, this massive hit from 1990 was given to Sinéad O'Connor by Prince, and honestly I don’t think he could have ever done this song justice the way she does on this one. This is probably one of the most heart-wrenching break-up songs ever recorded, and that is all thanks to O’Connor’s tearful vocal performance. Seriously, watch the music video, she’s literally crying. She may have been thinking of her recently passed father when that was recorded, but the emotion carries into the song’s topic too well for it to not be genuine. The rest of the song’s composition also suit the theme of the song well as well. The extended church organ chords and strings with the steady ‘90s drum beat and those ominous backing vocals, it’s quite chilling to listen to. The lyrics are simple, but very powerful; really captures the desperation to re-kindle a relationship that seems doomed. “It's been seven hours and 15 days…
      since you took your love away.” She’s literally counting the hours since the breakup. THAT is some desperate behavior. Or maybe perhaps the second verse’s lyrics? “It's been so lonely without you here, like a bird without a song. Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling… tell me baby, where did I go wrong? I could put my arms around every boy I see… but they'd only remind me of you.” The whole song just oozes heartbreak, and frankly, it’s not a very fun song to listen to... That’s what makes it so good! Sometimes the best art isn’t the kind that makes you happy, but the kind that makes you sad.

    commentary: "The single greatest soft rock song to ever be recorded, and probably the single most underrated hit from the ‘70s. Why were these guys relegated to a B-list pop act? These guys were amazing songwriters! “Everything I Own”, “Aubrey”, “Baby I’m-a Want You”, and “Guitar Man” are masterpieces of soft rock, where’s the retrospective accolades?! Maybe in the future, people will recognize the brilliance of this band, but in the meantime, I’ll be celebrating this song by putting it at #16 on my list. For this song, they really put the “soft” into soft rock. Everything about it, the quiet vocal performance by David Gates, the breezy acoustic guitar, the tasteful electric guitar licks, the string accompaniment, the tight drum kit, down to even it’s lyrics… EVERYTHING is so softly performed and expertly composed, that it is bound to put your mind at ease and relax your muscles. It’s like a warm bubble bath or a foot massage; it’s the most therapeutic song I’ve ever heard. I wish I could say more about it but it really is something you just gotta hear for yourself."

    artist: The Police
    year: "1983"
    genres:
      - New wave
      - Soft rock
    commentary: "One of the most misunderstood songs in pop history. When Sting is singing the lyrics “I’ll be watching you”, he means that literally. Like… he’s watching you change out of your clothes through your bedroom window, and yet there has been many-a father-daughter dances at weddings set to this tune. However, the voyeuristic subject matter doesn’t take away from this somber new wave ballad. In fact, it adds so much to it. The starting major-chord guitar arpeggios played by Andy Summers make it feel like a love song, but then the very next chord arpeggio is dissonant and in a minor key, to remind the listener that this song is MUCH more sinister than meets the ear. This is paired excellently with a steady bassline by Sting, a simple drum pattern by Steward Copeland. Sting then adds the icing on the cake with a solid vocal performance. Especially on that bridge, when he belts out the lyrics: “Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace. I dream at night; I can only see your face. I look around, but it's you I can't replace. I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace. I keep crying baby… baby… please…” After this early climax, the song is then dotted with some pleasant piano bits and some eerily hummed vocals, until we reach the outro, where Sting repeats the line “I’ll be watching you…” as the rest of the band sings the main verse lines, and the instrumentation fades us out. As an addendum, this song is a beginner’s trap for young guitarists. It sounds like it would be easy to play, what with some simple-sounding arpeggios, but once you look at the chords and the finger placement… oh boy… get ready to develop some early-life carpal tunnel. However, once you get it down, it’s a ton of fun to play. Never lose hope!"

    artist: P.M. Dawn
    year: "1991"
    genres:
      - Alternative hip hop
    commentary: "In the early ‘90s, hip hop was evolving quickly out of its early roots, as many different sub-genres took root all over the U.S. The most popular of these was easily gangsta rap from the west coast, as the likes of Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Doggy Dog among many others were charting pretty high and on a regular basis. However, it was a little duo from New Jersey that would score the first proper hip hop #1 of the decade. P.M. Dawn were part of a movement up in the New York/New Jersey scene of alternative hip hop, that broke from the standard “braggadocious” styles of rap in favor of a more philosophical and introspective style. Groups like A Tribe Called Quest, Digible Planets, and Digital Underground were among them. Although not a full-on alt hip hop act, P.M. Dawn’s #1 hit is still an amazing song of the genre. This song makes good use of the main hook sample of Spandau Ballet’s song “True” played alongside an angelic vocal harmony by the duo, Prince Be and DJ Minutemix. Throw in a damn-good catchy hip hop beat and some lightly dissonant percussion, and you have everything you need for a banger of an alt hip hop song. The song’s lyrical content is half Prince Be singing about a girl he saw in a dream and half a love-letter to then-contemporary actress Christina Applegate. It’s kinda wholesome how unapologetic he is on this one. It’s like he’s a boy singing to his crush, trying to get her to like him. Before I started this project, I never had heard this song, but after hearing it for the first time, I knew I had to place it high on the list. It sounds like what it would feel like to stand under a crystal-clear waterfall and let it wash you clean of your worries in life. There really isn’t anything on this list that feels like this one does."

    title: Kiss from a Rose
    artist: Seal
    year: "1995"
    genres:
      - Progressive soul
      - Neo-soul
    commentary: "If I had to rank these #1 hits by quality of the production, composition, and mixing, this song would crush every other song on this list. This is THE greatest synthesis of expert musicality and pop appeal. I don’t think there will ever be a pop song this well-crafted for a long while. This song had an interesting story. Originally when it was released, this British neo-soul song was hardly promoted and was quickly forgotten about by American listeners. However, it was film-maker Joel Schumacher who, in the middle of directing Batman Forever, petitioned to have this song included in the film. This was the catalyst that brought Seal’s talent into the spotlight, and it became an instant hit, and deservingly so. I really wish I could put into words how complex and multi-layered this song is, but I don’t have to. If you look up “Rick Beato Seal” on YouTube, you’ll see a great breakdown of the composition of the song, as well as an interview with Seal himself talking about what the song means to him. If I did have anything to say, it’s that this song has a truck load of POWER and PASSION, and hardly any song on this list can match it."

    title: Shout
    artist: Tears For Fears
    year: "1985"
    genres:
      - New wave
      - Synth-pop
    commentary: "Imagine It’s 1985, and your friend rushes to your house to tell you of this awesome song he just heard on the radio called “Shout”. He describes what it sounds like, and It piques your interest enough for you to roll on down to the closest record store and find it. The main clerk then hands you “Songs From The Big Chair” by Tears For Fears. You look at the album cover and immediately think that your friend just played a practical joke on you. What the hell is this? An Easy-listening jazz album? The front cover looks like a Christmas card you get from your gay neighbors (well, this is in the mid-80s, so I guess this part of the story is less likely to have happened). Despite the lame appearance of the front cover, the clerk tells you it’s good, and so you bring it home to listen to it, and the first track that plays is sure-enough “Shout”. 6 minutes later, you are sitting there questioning what the hell you just experienced. Either that, or you are ready to go out into the streets to tear shit up and rebel! This song was placed so high up on the list because it goes… so… HARD! It’s sounds like some long-lost Nine Inch Nails song that was made a good 5 years before they were ever known. This song is basically the beginning of ‘90s Industrial Metal if you ask me. Everything from the snappy drum machine loop, the ominous synths, the rebellious refrain of “Shout! Shout! Let it all out! These are the things I can do without, so come on!”, it’s got the grit and angst of a ‘90s rock staple… in 1985! And it was a #1 hit! The whole song is just one big build up, with every verse adds a new layer of angst, alongside the fitting lyrics about standing up and raising hell; there’s even a funky-as-hell breakdown in the middle which leads into an electric organ and digital bassline! It’s like every step of the song is a point-by-point argument as to why you shouldn’t be complacent and to stand up against the man! Just when you think it couldn’t get any more badass, Roland Orzabal gives us one of the greatest guitar solos of all-time. The Shout solo is one of the few solos that give me chills and goosebumps at the same time; it is so extremely fitting for the song and is the ultimate prize for following along. This is the ultimate call-to-action; protest all that is wrong with the world! Shout!"

    genres:

      - Disco-pop
      - Minneapolis sound
    commentary: "When Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars came together in 2014, they were on one mission: to create the “perfect” funk song… and they succeeded. Yes, even comparing it to the classics that it set out to emulate, I honestly think they overcame their greatness. This is basically the “Stairway to Heaven” of funk. It perfectly blends the sounds of early funk in the ‘60s all the way up to the Minneapolis funk of the ‘80s. Not a single second of this song is wasted. Every little start/stop, lyric, instrument, and ad-lib is perfectly placed to drive the song into funk overload. Easily the best part of this song is the rising build-up to each chorus with the “Don’t believe me, just watch!” refrain at the drop and those piercing synths overlayed the horn section lead. There’s not much else to say here; if you grew up in the ‘60s, ‘70s, or ‘80s, and you liked the funk of the day, then I highly recommend you check this song out."

    title: Dreams
    artist: Fleetwood Mac
    year: "1977"
    genres:
      - Soft rock
    commentary: "If there is one song that lives up to its title on this list, it’s this one. Never has a pop song been so dreamy in its composition. It sounds so big and yet, it is so simple in its structure. This song was written by lead vocalist Stevie Nicks in a single night during a time in Fleetwood Mac’s career when thing was not going well at all. Guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and she were separating, drummer Mick Fleetwood was going through a divorce and bassist John Mcvie and his wife, singer Christiane Mcvie, were separating as well. You’d think that this tension amongst the band would lead to disaster in the studio but somehow, they all managed to harness that negative energy into a collective, creative output that resulted in one of the best albums of the 1970s: “Rumours”. Hell, If I did a ranking of the best #1 albums of all time from the Billboard 200 chart, this would easily be my top spot. This song, “Dreams”, was the second single off the album and their only #1 hit. Everything from the steady 4/4 drum beat and bassline, the fade-in/fade-out ethereal guitar work sprinkled throughout the song, Stevie Nicks haunting vocals, and that soaring chorus with everyone singing harmonized backup vocals is just… perfect. There really isn’t anything I can complain about; even the production quality is top-notch! The funny thing is that this isn’t even the best song off the album (“The Chain” pretty much blows everything else out of the water if you ask me). That just goes to show you the talent Fleetwood Mac had in their prime. At a time when everyone was making quick-buck disco hits, Fleetwood Mac were expertly crafting songs that would be remembered throughout the years."

    title: Sledgehammer
    artist: Peter Gabriel
    year: "1986"
    genres:
      - Dance-rock
      - Blue-eyed soul
      - Funk
    commentary: "Another massive crossover hit of the ‘80s, and a damn fine example of blending genres to make one hell of a banger. In 1974, Peter Gabriel left the prog rock band, Genesis, to start a solo career of his own. He was more interested in making artsy rock music while Genesis wanted to stick to the early ‘70s prog rock sound. Ironically, both of them would go one to have massive pop successes with both of them having #1 hits literally next to each other (Genesis’ “Invisible Touch” was #1 the week before “Sledgehammer” hit the top of the charts). However, while Genesis (and Phil Collins respectively) went hard into to softening their sound to have to most pop appeal, Gabriel for the most part stuck to his art rock roots and constantly made music that blended artsy experimentation with catchy pop rhythms and melodies. Songs like “Solsbury Hill”, “Biko”, “Games Without Frontiers”, and “Shock The Monkey” are all great examples. “Sledgehammer” however, is his best work in this regard, in my opinion. In typical Peter Gabriel fashion, the song starts us off with an alluring flourish of a shakuhachi flute to draw us in… and then he hits us that horn section and an undeniably funky groove, pair with a solid bassline, simple drumbeat, and appropriate guitar lick! The groove gets even more nasty during the chorus when the “Sledgehammer!” refrain kicks in. However, the ultimate groove hits you at the climax of the song when the shakuhachi flute returns as an addendum to the instrumentation, and Peter Gabriel, along with a soulful choir, belts out a commanding set of lyrics to fade us out. Truly a moment of badassery in funk music. Oh yeah, and that’s without mentioning the amazing music video that goes along with this song. Very clever and creative use of Claymation and stop-motion animation, much deserving of all its accolades throughout the years. When it comes to crossover #1 hits, this is undeniably the best one out of them all – An excellent blending of worldbeat, funk, new wave, and art rock."

    title: Hey Jude
    artist: The Beatles
    year: "1968"
    genres:
      - Pop rock
    commentary: "This is THE Beatles piano ballad. There is hardly a Beatles song that better encapsules the poppy, singable, whimsical, and hopeful in a single package better then this one. Written by Paul McCartney, this one’s about John Lennon’s son Jules, who was just a little boy when his parents were going through a nasty divorce. McCartney was visiting Jules one day, and feeling bad for the kid, wrote the song on the car ride home. The lyrics are really some of the best “simple” lyrics you can get from a pop song; it’s directly pointed towards Jules: “Hey Jude… don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better. Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better. Hey Jude… don’t be afraid. You were made to go out and get her. The minute you let her under your skin, then you begin… to make it better.” Sung along with those somber, and yet hopeful and optimistic piano chords really tugs at the heart strings. Throw in some tambourines and Ringo on the kit (and in the pocket as well!) and you got yourself an anthem of hope. However, what makes this song is the epic is it’s coda section. With Paul climbing up the scale with “better, better, better, better, better…” and then hitting that impressive high note on that scream is very impressive. Then, we are treated to the group sung “nah… nah, nah, nana na nah! Nana na nah! Hey Jude!” lyric for the last 4 minutes. Yeah, the real meat of the song is only about 3 minutes long, but if I had to rank the “filler” of this song, this would easily be the best damn filler of a song to ever been recorded. The way the whole band leans into it and carries the song into the clouds… it just gives you a warm feeling inside when you sing along, as if everything is gonna be alright. I hope Jules found peace in his parents’ separation, and I hope he found comfort in the words of his loving and sincere “uncle” Paul."

    title: American Pie
    artist: Don McLean
    year: "1972"
    genres:
      - Folk rock
    commentary: "Originally, this song wasn’t even included on my list when I finished the project. Somehow, this song got lost in the mix of things, and I have no clue as to why; this is a masterpiece of storytelling and of folk rock. Until just a few weeks ago, this was the longest song to be a #1 hit, clocking in at 8 minutes 42 seconds. You’d think a real song like this one would be far from a big hit; pop audiences tend to only like short, quick songs they can dance to, but this song bucks this trend HARD. I think that’s because this song is just so ENGAGING. It’s not just some folksy song with vague lyrics and an esoteric message, it’s a song that uses clever little vignettes to tell the story of “The Day The Music Died” which was an actual event in U.S. History: February 3, 1959. A plane carrying early rock and roll stars Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and “The Big Bopper” J.P. Richardson crashed in Iowa, killing all three. This was a particularly devastating event because at the time, rock didn’t have too many stars and when three of the biggest ones die all in the same day, one can see why this was so tragic. Each vignette (or verse) is told from the perspective of different people of that day and of the culture leading up to the present day of 1972, and it’s not done in some plain-Jane “I was working at a Woolworth when the news came over the radio”. Instead, it’s told with vivid detail, metaphor, and cultural reference. For example: The “King” is an obvious reference to Elvis Presley, and the “Jester” is supposed to be Bob Dylan. These are just two examples, but if you look at the rest of the lyrics, the many interpretations are too many to count. However, don’t let the wordy, multi-faceted SIX verses shy you away; the whole sonic structure of the song is expertly crafted to evoke the catchy and exciting nostalgia of the late ‘50s rock and roll movement; all with a singable chorus that everyone can sing and ending with that line “This’ll be the day that I die…” leaves you wanting to hear what the next part of the story is. It’s more than just a fun, romp of a song, it’s a cultural experience. If I had to elect one song to represent Americana, this would be my pick. It perfectly encapsulates a hopeful and energetic optimism at a time when America was going through a rough patch, and all with somber lyrics about the death of some important artists, Ironically enough. I have to commend Don McLean for that, because it’s really hard to be happy when everything’s going oh so wrong."

    title: El Paso
    artist: Marty Robbins
    year: "1960"
    genres:
      - Country
      - Tex-Mex
    commentary: "Very rarely in the Hot 100 era of the Billboard Magazine did a country song reach #1. Before 1958, there were plenty of country/western songs that managed to reach #1 as the new Rock and Roll music was heavily influenced by country, blues, and folk, so there was plenty of overlap. However, by 1960, Doo-wop and R&B had pretty much taken over as the “pop” of the day, and the played-straight, country western had fallen to the wayside indefinitely. However, it was in the first week on the ‘60s decade that Marty Robbins managed to climb to #1 with this Tex-Mex single and was probably the last “real” country song to reach #1, as every other #1 hit to come after this one was influenced by other genres. Anyone who doesn’t listen to a lot of country (me, to my shame) may see the placement of this song so high on the list and scratch their heads. Maybe amongst dyed-in-the-wool country listeners, this seems like a no-brainer, but when you factor in every other genre from the ‘60s, this seems far from a legendary song from that decade, and to be honest I kinda agree. However, I HAD to rank it this high because it fails to raise ANY red flags. This song is basically the equivalent of an Olympic gymnast sticking a perfect-ten landing. It ticks all the boxes for a “perfect” song: Well-composed, well-mixed, well-written, well-structured, well-performed; not a single moment of this song is wasted; it’s all killer, no filler! Everything from Marty Robbins’ amazing vocal performance (along with those backing vocals), to the clever blending of each verse into the next, with the repeated motif of the “El paso” lyric at the beginning of every verse, the pleasant and unique Spanish guitar lines sprinkled throughout, and a super engaging story of a hopeless romantic fighting to the death for the love of a “dancer” in the wild west setting of El Paso, Texas; it really all comes together to make the closest we are getting to a “perfect” country song."

    title: Gangsta's Paradise
    artist: Coolio feat. L.V.
    year: "1995"
    genres:
      - Hip hop
      - Gangsta rap
      - G-funk
    commentary: "Easily my favorite Hip hop #1 hit, maybe my favorite hip hop song ever honestly. I really do feel like the greatness of this song transcends tastes; I think if you put this song on, most people would like it regardless of what they listen to on a regular basis. Really, the main reason why I love this song so much is the story it tells. When it comes to storytelling in a song, Coolio really puts everyone else on this list to shame. This is a grim, tragic, and somber cautionary tale of life as a gang member. Coolio is no stranger to the mean streets of Compton, California; when he was a teen, he was a member of the “Baby Crips”, a youth shoot-off of the famous gang, which makes the lyrics feel like that of a sage. Case in point – the opening line referencing the Bible verse, Psalms 29: “As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I take a look at my life and realize there’s nothin’ left… ‘Cause I’ve been blastin’ and laughin’ so long, that even my mama thinks that my mind has gone”. This opening line really sets the mood for the whole song, and the rest of the lyrics are just as tragic. Lyrics like “I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc; as they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke…” and “Death ain’t nothin’ but a heartbeat away, I’m livin’ life do or die, what can I say? I’m 23 now, but will I live to see 24? The way things is goin’ I don’t know…” hammer home the fragility of the lifestyle, and Coolio sees himself as disposable; one step away from death. Another tragic theme is that of hopelessness. The lyrics “Look at the situation they got me facin’, I can’t live a normal life, I was raised by the street, so I gotta be down with the hood team… Too much television watchin’ got me chasin’ dreams…” show that he doesn’t see himself ever escaping this lifestyle; trapped in the game. The closing line on the final verse is the nail in the coffin: “They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me. If they can't understand it, how can they reach me? I guess they can't… I guess they won't… I guess they frontin'… that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!” Of course, the ultimate takeaway from the story is the bridge section, sung by L.V.: “Tell me why are we… so blind to see… that the ones we hurt… are you and me?” This is all without even mentioning the bumpin’ beat that supports the song, an interpolation of Stevie Wonder’s “Pastime Paradise”, which is just fantastic. The whole song has the iconic string section on repeat, and during the chorus we get that soaring, angelic choir that sings alongside L.V., who busts out an amazing vocal performance on the hook: “Been/keep spending most our lives livin’ in a gangsta’s paradise…” This one’s a crowning achievement for hip hop; really elevates the artform to much higher level. There will probably never be a song in the genre to transcend this one in heart and expression."

    title: Let's Get It On
    artist: Marvin Gaye
    year: "1973"
    genres:
      - Soul
      - R&B
    commentary: "There is an interesting bit of irony with this song. The contrast between this song’s message and Marvin Gaye’s upbringing is immense… almost as if there was some kind of divine (or perhaps counter-divine?) destiny in the making of it: Marvin Gaye was raised by a father who was an ordained minister of a Pentecostal church, which is for the most part, a very evangelical sect of Christianity. At one point, Marvin even contemplated in following in his father’s footsteps in becoming a minster himself. However, he instead went on to be one the greatest soul artists of all-time, and went on to write this song, which is probably the most sexually liberating song to have ever been written to this day. It’s important to remember that in 1973, America was a lot more evangelical, and the explicit topic of sex in media was still too racy for most people. Hell, the “Hays Code” was still being followed in Hollywood up until 1968, just a mere four years before this song came out. Your average American would have probably rejected or outright protested a song like this, to this song’s credit, its message has outlasted its detractors. Contrary to what most spoof comedies and rom coms think this song is about: A song about unadulterated sex, it really is about liberation. Just look at these lyrics: “We’re all sensitive people with so much to give”, “…giving yourself to me can never be wrong, if the love is true”, “Don’t you know how sweet and wonderful life can be?”, “You don’t have to worry that it’s wrong”. This song isn’t about “getting it on”. It’s about destigmatizing sex and telling the listener that it’s OKAY to get it on. I mean, if ours is a society that stigmatizes the act, we might as well go all the way and stigmatize walking or eating. It’s preposterous that we needed a slow jam like this one to smarten us up. Speaking of, never has a song’s composition fit the theme of its lyrics as good as this one. The steady groove on the drums and bass with that “I-iii-IV-V” Chord progression evokes this feeling of positivity and hope. Sprinkle in some ad-libed wah guitar licks, a tasteful horn and string section, and some solid backing vocals; it really makes it hard to think bad thoughts while this song is playing. That without mentioning Gaye’s fantastic vocal performance. His range is immaculate, and his conviction is strong. It’s almost like he’s his father: a minister preaching to his followers about sexually liberating themselves from a world of prudes and fuddy duddys. Funny how things turned out for Gaye – he really did become a minister, but not in the way his father expected."

    title: (Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay
    artist: Otis Redding
    year: "1968"
    genres:
      - Soul
      - R&B
    commentary: "I think we all have those moments of pure contemplation. Whenever we are doing menial tasks or driving home after work; we all have those moment of quiet peace where we rack our brains and just… think about stuff. Its moments like that where we develop the most as people, and it’s this song I think best captures that feeling more than any other. Otis Redding wrote the first verse while on a plane ride to Memphis and knowing he had a hit on his hands, called his good friend and fellow songwriter Steve Cropper immediately after he landed to tell him he’s was going to the studio THAT NIGHT to work on it. They both met there and hashed out the rest of the song. This simple song tells the story of Redding, who grew up in Georgia, moving all the way to San Francisco – from east coast to west coast. He’s worked so hard as an artist that he’s basically gotten everything he’s ever wanted, including a nice boathouse in the ‘Frisco bay… but he feels as if nothing has changed at all. He’s still his same old self, and now he’s just relaxing; sittin’ on the dock of the bay… contemplating. The songs starts us off with a softly strummed acoustic guitar, a warm bassline, and the sound of crashing waves; an intro that pulls us in with it’s calm demeanor, before going into the first verse sung by Redding: “Sittin' in the mornin' sun… I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come. Watching the ships roll in… and then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah…” The melancholic lyrics change the tone of the song from warm and fuzzy to borderline existential and uncertain. The whole song carries this tone throughout, while remaining catchy with the insatiable groove of Steve Cropper’s tasteful guitar licks. Even during the bridge section, which shifts gears for a moment to something a bit more hopeful sounding, it still remains melancholic and eventually comes back to its existential ponderance with the lyric “I can’t do what ten people tell me to do, so I guess I’ll remain the same…” The songs then fades us out after one last contemplative chorus with Redding doing some improv whistling, signifying that this tale remains unresolved. Indeed, this story would remain unresolved forever; just a mere two weeks later after recording the song, Redding would die in a plane crash on December 10, 1967. A combination of his death and the mass appeal of this hit song lead to his one and only #1 hit, and the first posthumous #1 hit in Billboard chart history. It’s a shame his life was cut so short, as this song was the beginning of a shift in his musical style that seemed to be much more honed and polished. Had he lived on, we may have had many-a soul hits that could have stood the test of time, but alas, those hits were never to be written."

    title: Georgia On My Mind
    artist: Ray Charles
    year: "1960"
    genres:
      - Soul
      - Traditional Pop
    commentary: "You know, a lot of the songs that on this list are… well… good, at least in my opinion they are. However, most of these songs are either long forgotten in the grand scheme of things or are relics of their time. Some of them surpass that threshold and become classics to stand the test of time. However, very rarely does that “test of time” go beyond those that lived to hear it in its original context. Take for example the song “Don’t You (Forget about Me)” by Simple Minds. I would consider that a classic of the ‘80s, but a hundred years from now when everyone from that era of music is long gone, will it still be played? I mean, of course there will be people who listen to it, but will it still be a “staple” of our collective culture? Will it invoke the same feelings it did to those who heard it for the first time in 1985? Will people still associate it with the film “The Breakfast Club”? I don’t know, but there’s a good chance it won’t. Unfortunately, there is a limited amount of space we have in out collective minds to celebrate the past, which means we will have to pick and choose what’s worth remembering. It is with that being said, that out of all of the songs on this list, “Georgia On My Mind” is the only one that I think people will still celebrate long into the distant future. Assuming the United States is still around in the year of 2500, I can guarantee that people will still play it and celebrate it as not only a cultural piece representing Georgia, the state, but the United States as a whole. Originally written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell in 1930, it was made to be a nice blend of ragtime, jazz, and contemporary pop. It has a nice breezy swing to it, and an earnest vocal performance by Carmichael himself. It’s a good song all on its own, but Ray Charles’ interpretation elevates it into beyond legendary status. This song was made to be slowed down and soul-ified, and Ray Charles knocked it out of the park. Actually, scratch that – he knocked it out of orbit. The soft string intro gives way to the heartfelt vocals of Charles: “Georgia… Georgia… The whole day through… just an old sweet song… keeps Georgia on my mind.” You can tell that this song meant a whole lot to him. He was born and raised in Georgia, so it would make sense that he would put his heart and soul into it. However, it’s the refrain of this song that just breaks me down. “Other arms a-reach out to me… other eyes smile tenderly… still in peaceful dreams I see… the road leads back to you.” This is how I interpret it: Charles had an unfortunate upbringing; in that he had gone blind by age 7 due to glaucoma. By that time, he still hadn’t left his home state of Georgia which means his only frame of reference, visually speaking, would have been his home of Georgia. However, something tells me that at night when he dreamt, that he could see clear as day, and that maybe for just a fleeting moment… he could see his home once again with clear and open eyes. That hits hard for me. Ray Charles’ performance of this song was so good that in a mere 19 years, the State of Georgia had made it their state song in 1979. That’s the power this song has. Many other states adopted songs from many a decade removed from its inauguration and were mostly comprised of old band numbers and songs from folklore, which makes sense. They needed to pick something that was not only representative of their state. but had enough cultural significance to be recognizable long into the distant future. 19 years… that’s all it took for Ray Charles’ version of “Georgia On My Mind” to reach that milestone."

    title: Bridge Over Troubled Water
    artist: Simon & Garfunkel
    year: "1970"
    genres:
      - Pop
      - Gospel
    commentary: |-
      Dedicated to Nancy Horton Robards… my biggest fan.

      “Perfect” Is one of those words that a critic should almost always avoid. Besides, how can something as subjective as music be perfect? After all, what’s perfect for one person may be a train wreck to another. However, I think my use of the word “perfect” is one that is very universal and optimistic. The “perfect” song is one that your grandfather would play on the piano to cheer you up when you were having a bad day. The “perfect” song is the one that your cool bus driver from 1st grade would play on his cassette player on your way to school every morning and get you to sing along to. The “perfect” song is one that helped you out of a dark place during a low point in your life. The “perfect” song is one that your lover, your soulmate, shares with you; to celebrate the time you’ve spent together on this green earth. The “perfect” song is the one that your friend from high school would mockingly sing to you to embarrass you in front of your crush. The “perfect” song is the one that you sang at the top of your lungs with your brothers and sisters on that one road trip to Florida all those years ago. In other words, the “perfect” song is the one that matters the most to you in those moments of your life… when you needed them the most. I can’t say that “Bridge Over Troubled Water” by Simon & Garfunkel has ever been that song to me, but I’d like to imagine that to many people, it has been.

      Of course, me being a big music nerd, I can’t help but claim that, by some objective measure, this is the closest I’ve ever been to thinking a song is just outright “perfect”. Not just as a pop song, or a folk song, or a gospel song, or even as a #1 hit… but as a song in of itself. I think it’s a safe bet to say that this is probably the greatest song of the 20th century. Never has a song carried with it the emotion, power, technicality, precision, heart, and soul as much as this this one. Listening to it is like a transcendent experience… every time I listen to it. This is a song that, after hearing it for the second time ever in my entire life (Yeah, I don’t know how this song eluded me for 26 years), brought me to tears. It was at that moment that I knew this was going to be my favorite #1 hit, and that no song from the following years could ever surpass it in any way, and none ever did.

      It’s actually very similar to another song that I personally think is the greatest song of the 19th century, “Clair De Lune” by Claude DeBussy, in that it is a piano suite. The song originally was written by Paul Simon on guitar in early 1969 after listening to the song “Mary Don’t You Weep” by the gospel group, The Swan Silvertones. The song contained the line “I’ll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in my name”. According to Simon, it just “came to him very quickly.” He also pulled inspiration for the melody from an old Christian hymn, composed by Bach called “O Sacred Head, Now Wounded”. However, at some point, he decided to transcribe it to piano with session musician Larry Knechtel to fit the gospel nature of the song, and before he knew it, he had a piano ballad on his hands. After recording a quick demo, he then presented it to arranger Ernie Freeman, to include a string arrangement, done by the famous “Wrecking Crew”, a group of prolific session musicians of the era, to make the song even more gospely and angelic. The end result was this:
      The song starts us off with a flooring series of piano chords, expertly played by Larry Knechtel. At first, it sounds quite somber but then it softly rises back up to a major key and establishes the progression leading into the first verse, sung by Art Garfunkel: “When you’re weary, feeling small… When tears are in your eyes… I’ll dry them all.” Paul and Art had a bit of a turbulent relationship when it came to music, and there’s supposedly a rumor that when asked why Paul keep Art around, he said with sincerely something along the lines of: “…because he has the voice that I hear in my head when I write the songs.” Let’s not mince words here: this IS Art’s song – this song was made for his voice, and no other person can ever match it. Many artists would cover this song, but NO ONE can sing it like Art can. This is easily his best vocal performance, and the best vocal performance in pop history, hands down. Never has a voice been so soft, smooth, fragile, and vulnerable. This is a song about friendship. About being there for someone when they are having a rough time. It’s a song of reassurance that no matter what, we will be there to help them through and be their shining light, even in darkness… to be their bridge over troubled water. “I’m on your side, oh, when times get rough… and friends just can’t be found… Like a bridge over troubled water… I will lay me down.” The last line being of course taken from the classic children’s bedtime prayer, which suits the gospel nature of the song perfectly.

      It’s during the second chorus when Art goes from a soft and vulnerable voice, to a high-noted, pained vibrato. I like to think this signifies the moment when Art takes on the pain of his friend, as to keep them from getting hurt and to shield them from all that aims to hurt them. This is also when we get the subtle and delicate introduction of the bass and some light percussion. Which gives us a reprieve from the pain and a moment of rest and reflection. However, its right after that the strings sneak in, with Simon providing backing vocals and it’s just… absolutely angelic: “Sail on silver girl… sail on by…. your time has come to shine… all your dreams are on their way.” It’s at this point that the song’s lyrics shift towards what appears to be a lover of some kind; the support goes from taking on someone else’s pain to providing moral support for a loved one… to push them towards their dreams and help them in their endeavors. “See how they shine, oh, if you need a friend… I’m sailing right behind… like a bridge over troubled water… I will ease your mind.” The song launches into a massive crescendo with Art belting out an impressively high note, and with what appears to be the sound of a cannon shot, the song is then is closed by the string arrangement… holding onto a high, sustained note.

      Not. One. Second… Of this song is wasted. Every possible opportunity to make each second count, to make the composition perfect, was taken. Simon & Garfunkel would go on to win 5 Grammy’s at the 1971 awards ceremony, including “Song of the Year” and “Best Arrangement, Instrumental & Vocals”. A very much well-deserved award, that last one.

      …and that’s it, folks! My favorite song to reach #1 in the U.S! It only took listening to over 1,100 songs, but we came out clean on the other side! For everyone that has been reading these posts and liking and commenting, thank you so much for the support. I never thought I’d ever reach the end of this project, but I’m glad I did. It was fun listening to all this music – I definitely will be “borrowing” some ideas from what I heard and utilizing them into my playing when I pick up my guitar, that’s for sure. I’ll also be mixing a good chunk of these songs into my future playlists; and maybe I’ll use some of them as an excuse to expand my listening into new territories and discover some new stuff!
      I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… there really isn’t any “bad” music from the past or present. Every year had its ups, it’s downs, and plenty of middling songs that’s for sure, but ultimately, if you open your mind a bit and listen closely, you’ll always find good music at any period. For anyone who grew up during a certain period of the Hot 100’s history or are around my age and listen to the newest stuff, I implore you to check out the decades you missed out on and get curious with your tastes. I know I did, and look at me now; I got so much stuff sitting in my backlog now… I may have to start reviewing some of it! Who knows…?

      Once again, thank you all for the support!
