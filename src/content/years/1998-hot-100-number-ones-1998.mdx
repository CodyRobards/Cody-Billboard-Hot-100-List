commentary: "We did it! We've manage to have a year beat out 1978 for \"Most Meh Year\"! Not a single song from this year is featured on my best or worst #1 hits of all-time lists. Man, it's a shame that this year wasn't all that much better than last year. I really hope that the final year of the '90s is good, I'd hate to end on such a low-note."

    title: Candle In The Wind 1997/Something About the Way You Look Tonight
    artist: Elton John
    notes:
      - '"Candle In The Wind 1997"'
      - A re-recording of John's 1973 hit, a tribute to the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died earlier in 1997
      - It's an okay re-recording, the '90s production sheen really takes away the simple charm of the original; I definitely perfer the original
      - '"Something About the Way You Look Tonight"'
      - Solid chorus; well performed
      - Everything else around the chorus is just "meh"; John is definitely well out of his prime here
  - position: 2
    title: Truly Madly Deeply
    artist: Savage Garden
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo pop duo song
      - Nice vocal cadence; very consistant
      - Not a half-bad chorus
      - I wouldn't concider it anything too special
  - position: 3
    title: Together Again
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - Dance/House song
      - Interesting harp intro; goes into the jazzy house part of the song shortly after
      - I really like that jazz chord progression; nice to see it in a pop song
      - Chorus is pretty catchy
      - Song is good, but far from legendary
  - position: 4
    title: Nice & Slow
    artist: Usher
    notes:
      - A "Nice and slow" R&B song
      - Neat acoustic guitar under the mix
      - Usher's rapping section isn't too bad
      - Honestly, this feels like a better version of "Freak Me" by Silk, which really isn't saying much
  - position: 5
    title: My Heart Will Go On
    artist: Céline Dion
    notes:
      - Slow pop ballad written for the film "Titanic"
      - Nice use of the tin whistle; very pleasent
      - I really like how the song builds up to that final chorus
      - Great vocal performace from Dion
  - position: 6
    title: Gettin' Jiggy wit It
    artist: Will Smith
    notes:
      - Did you know that Will Smith started as a rapper before he got into TV and Film?
      - This time he is without his partner-in-crime, DJ Jazzy Jeff
      - Very upbeat and funky
      - Smith's flow is on-point; it may be pretty sterile and clean, but it suits his style well enough
      - Very catchy chorus with that "Na na na na na na na!" refrain
  - position: 7
    title: All My Life
    artist: K-Ci & Jojo
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song
      - They both harmonize very well, but their voices just aren't made for smooth R&B
      - The whole mix is very basic and sterile; lacks character
      - It's not bad, but it is painfully mediocre
  - position: 8
    title: Too Close
    artist: Next
    notes:
      - Funky R&B song
      - I think this was the basis for that "Why you always lyin'?" Vine meme from a few years ago
      - Solid vocal performance from all involved
      - It's really just a solid R&B song; not much to complain about
  - position: 9
    title: My All
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Carey's first attempt at a Latin pop song
      - Besides Carey's great vocal performance, the song as a whole is just real boring
  - position: 10
    title: The Boy Is Mine
    artist: Brandy & Monica
    notes:
      - "A monster of an R&B Song, #1 for 13 consectutive weeks"
      - The fast harp arpeggios under the song are kinda neat
      - The electric pop & slap bassline is also kinda neat
      - No clue as to why this one topped the chart for so long, it's really just an okay song
  - position: 11
    title: I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing
    artist: Aerosmith
    notes:
      - Song written for the film "Armageddon"
      - "Weird seeing an only '70s rock band getting a #1 this late in their career; this one's a symphonic power ballad"
      - I really like those ominous strings in the intro; very nice
      - Steven Tyler's vocal performance is pretty good too
      - Solid chorus; very epic-sounding
      - Okay... NOW this has to be the last '80s power ballad. It only took another 8 years for the '80s to truely end!
  - position: 12
    title: The First Night
    artist: Monica
    notes:
      - Solid Diana Ross sample under the song; ("Love Hangover")
      - I kind of like the chorus; it has a nice vocal cadence
      - I will say this one's better than "The Boy Is Mine", but it's still just "okay"
  - position: 13
    title: One Week
    artist: Barenaked Ladies
    notes:
      - "Pop Rock song; wow... took a while for one these to reach #1 again"
      - 'By the way, this song was #1 for only just "one week"'
      - Wow, these lyrics are hilarious, and their delivery is insanely fast
      - '"Chickity China, the Chinese Chicken" is such an absurd lyric; I love it'
      - I really do like that eerie chorus; really stands out from the poppy verses
  - position: 14
    title: Doo Wop (That Thing)
    artist: Lauryn Hill
    notes:
      - Rap/R&B song
      - Insanely funky; very throwbacky to the Motown era
      - The instrumentation is on-point here; very tight and well-performed
      - Very solid chorus; well-done with all those backing vocals
      - Hill's flow is really good; works well with the beat
  - position: 15
    title: Lately
    artist: Divine
    notes:
      - R&B ballad
      - Real nice arpeggiated electric-guitar chords throughout the song
      - Great vocal harmonies; it's like an all-women Boyz II Men
      - The composition is very well done; not overbearing or cheesy
  - position: 16
    title: I'm Your Angel
    artist: R. Kelly & Céline Dion
    notes:
      - Interesting duet; never thought I'd see Dion sing an R. Kelly song
      - Not all that great; I guess the vocal performances are good, but the song as a whole is boring
