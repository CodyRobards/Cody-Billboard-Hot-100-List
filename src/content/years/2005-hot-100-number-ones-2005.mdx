commentary: "Another plain, boring year. That might be because there was only 8 SONGS THAT WENT TO #1 THIS YEAR. That ties with 1958, and that was the year the Billboard Hot 100 was created and that started in August of that year! I mean that doesn't mean that the year is bad by default, but the songs that did top the chart really weren't all that great. If only there was more to judge this year by, I'd maybe like it but unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Let's hope that next year is better."

    title: Let Me Love You
    artist: Mario
    notes:
      - Smooth R&B song
      - I like the bridge section; the chord changes are very ethereal and kinda spooky
      - I will say, this is at least one notch better than most of Usher's stuff
  - position: 2
    title: Candy Shop
    artist: 50 Cent feat. Olivia
    notes:
      - Very similar to last year's "Lean Back" by Terror Squad
      - Explicitly sexual lyrics; I would like the song if it went harder, but 50 Cent and Olivia both sound so bored on this one
  - position: 3
    title: Hollaback Girl
    artist: Gwen Stefani
    notes:
      - Gwen Stefani of '90s pop-punk band No Doubt, turned white girl rapping
      - I can't lie; it is a catchy song but my God, it's so cringy... We truely live in an alternate reality, elsewise this would have not transpired.
      - I also gotta admit that "This shit is Bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!" is a pretty funny line
      - I really wish I could write this song off as a "tongue-in-cheek", "all-for-fun-don't-take-it-seriously" song, but Stefani's attempt at trying to sound cool and edgy on a song this silly is what pushes it overboard for me
  - position: 4
    title: We Belong Together
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - "Carey's comeback single; was #1 for 14 non-consectutive weeks and the longest running #1 of the '00s decade... is a worty comeback?"
      - Well, I will say that this is a lot more compelling than most of the '00s R&B we've heard so far
      - Another great vocal performance from Carey; especially towards the end of the song
      - A good song, but I don't really think it's "legendary" as it may seem
  - position: 5
    title: Inside Your Heaven
    artist: Carrie Underwood
    notes:
      - "Our first country #1 hit song in a while; a bit of a slow ballad"
      - This one actually reminds me of "I Don'y Wanna Miss A Thing" by Aerosmith; it sounds a bit different, but it "feels" the same
      - Great vocal performace by Underwood here; really carries the song
      - Solid ballad; better than most we've heard so far this decade
  - position: 6
    title: Gold Digger
    artist: Kayne West feat. Jamie Foxx
    notes:
      - Hip hop song; samples the Ray Charles song "I Got a Woman"
      - Solid flows by West, also great lyrics; kinda silly, but fits the theme of the song well
      - Not much else to say; it's a pretty good song
  - position: 7
    title: Run It!
    artist: Chris Brown feat. Juelz Santana
    notes:
      - "First #1 hit by Chris Brown; released when he was only 16-years-old"
      - Chris Brown beats women
      - This song sounds very similar to "Yeah!" by Usher; just a little bit more restrained
      - I guess the chorus is kinda catchy
      - Santana's verse is actually pretty solid
  - position: 8
    title: Don't Forget About Us
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Oh no, Mariah don't!
      - Dang, she fell for the "slow boring '00s R&B sound"...
      - Well, I guess I can't say that the song's bad since it's Carey singing; her voice tends to salt the song to palatable status
      - Eh, I guess it's okay enough
