commentary: Good year; can't say it was out-of-this-world, but for the most part, I liked all of them. The novelty of trap rap is wearing a bit thin, but the production quality is still top-notch, and the talent is still there. We are almost done folks! Just one more year left! 2020 let's go!
year: 2019
numberOnes:
  - title: Thank U, Next
    artist: Ariana Grande
    notes:
      - It's basically a pop version of "To All The Girls I've Loved Before" by Julio Iglesias & Willie Nelson, except it's from the girls perspective
      - I like the dreamy keys that drive the song; they almost have a "Christmas" feel to it
      - Solid vocal performance by Grande on this one; suits the song very well
      - "I never thought I'd ever hear a happy break-up song, let alone one that went to #1"
  - title: Without Me
    artist: Halsey
    notes:
      - I like the reverb-effect on the guitar that drives the beat; it sounds like it's being played at the bottom of the ocean
      - Solid chorus; Halsey's voice is pretty good here
      - Good song; solid production and mixing on this one
  - title: Sunflower
    artist: Post Malone & Swae Lee
    notes:
      - 'Dreamy hip hop song; written for the film "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"'
      - I like that staggered rhythm that drives the song; it's got spunk!
      - The bass synths are fantastic; really gives the song a big sound
      - Both Swae Lee and Post Malone have really good voices on this one; sometimes rappers can sound angelic!
  - title: 7 Rings
    artist: Ariana Grande
    notes:
      - Looks like trap rap has found it's way into the standard pop number
      - The scotch snaps during the chorus remind me of Destiny's Child a bit; not half-bad
      - Okay, the rap verse by Grande towards the end is hiliarious; she's got a good flow, but she sounds like a chipmunk
  - title: Shallow
    artist: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper
    notes:
      - Acoustic ballad; main single off of the soundtrack of the 2018 "A Star Is Born" remake
      - Solid chord progression on the acoustic guitar; reminds me of "Stay (I Missed You)" by Lisa Loeb a bit
      - Cooper's voice isn't half-bad for someone whos main profession is acting
      - Of course Gaga's voice steals the show; especially during that chorus
  - title: Sucker
    artist: Jonas Brothers
    notes:
      - "Pop rock song; first #1 hit for the boy band, and it's a decade after their peak popularity in the late '00s"
      - It's hard to tell all of their voices apart, but they all sound good for the most part.
      - It's catchy and funky, but it sounds almost exactly like "Feel It Still" by Portugal. The Man
  - title: Old Town Road
    artist: Lil' Nas X feat. Billy Ray Cyrus
    notes:
      - "We did it folks. We've finally surpassed \"One Sweet Day\" by Boyz II Men & Mariah Carey as the longest running #1 hit. This time, this one ran 19 weeks consectutively... and it's a self-produce trap rap song about riding horses. Ha!"
      - Solid beat; uses a Nine Inch Nails sample which is probably why I like it
      - Billy Ray Cyrus' voice somehow managed to hold up after all of these years
      - Lil' Nas X's verses are so funny to listen to; he clearly doesn't give AF
      - I never thought I'd hear Billy Ray Cyrus rap... and it's actually not half-bad either
  - title: Bad Guy
    artist: Billie Eilish
    notes:
      - That's one hell of a sinister bassline; just glad to hear a proper electric bass
      - The staggered whispered vocals are an interesting creative choice; it's like a drunk ghost singing the song
      - The electric keys that play after the chorus are so silly; it's like something out of Austin Powers
      - I like the breakdown towards the end; makes the song a little less silly for sure
  - title: Señorita
    artist: Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello
    notes:
      - Latin pop song
      - Cabello's vocals on the chorus are just a little too shrill for my tasteful
      - Mendes' voice isn't half-bad; I do think he's the better half of this song
      - Honestly, hey actually have a pretty good vocal chemistry
      - It's not a bad song, but it's nothing too special
  - title: Truth Hurts
    artist: Lizzo
    notes:
      - Trap rap song; originally released in 2017, but became a sleeper hit this year
      - The ragtime piano that drives the melody is neat
      - Solid beat and Lizzo's flows are on-point
      - She sounds like a better version of Cardi-B, honestly
      - Funny lyrics, and she pulls them off well
  - title: Highest in the Room
    artist: Travis Scott
    notes:
      - Scotts' performance just feels lazy on this one; he sounds as boring as the beat for this song
  - title: Someone You Loved
    artist: Lewis Capaldi
    notes:
      - Piano ballad; nice hearing one of these amongst all of the trap
      - Capaldi's got a great vocal range, and his performance during that chorus and bridge is fantastic
      - Overall, just a well-composed and made pop song
  - title: Lose You to Love Me
    artist: Selena Gomez
    notes:
      - Two piano ballads in a row!
      - I like the chord progression; very somber and a little bit sinister
      - Gomez's voice is great; I really like when the chorus brings in those backing vocals
      - I do kind of wish there was more to the song; seems incomplete
  - title: Circles
    artist: Post Malone
    notes:
      - Great reverberated acoustic-guitar; and that bassline is great!
      - The whole song has this hazy dream feel to it; I like it
      - Malone's vocal performance is great here; I love the reverb and tremolo he puts on the chorus
      - Honestly, I think Post Malone should just stick to doing harmonic singing; it suits him very well
  - title: Heartless
    artist: The Weeknd
    notes:
      - Trap rap song; it's got this '80s synthwave feel to it
      - Solid beat and The Weeknd is really going hard on this one
      - The chorus is very catchy and I love the reverb on his voice
      - The breakdown on the bridge is fantastic; it's like a bubble-bath in music form
  - title: All I Want for Christmas Is You
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Whoa, this is NOT a contemporary song... this one was released back in 1994! I guess it's a testament to how much this song has eclipsed any and all other Christmas in popularity
      - ...and rightfully so; this is probably the "perfect" Christmas song. It's got the best chord-progression, the best instrumentation, the best vocal performance, and the best song topic of any Christmas pop song I've ever heard
