commentary: 'Wow, we starting this decade with a whimper. It was either a boring ballad or just an "okay" song; even the good songs lacked that "umph" that a lot of the past #1 hits had. I REALLY hope next year is much better.'
year: 1990
numberOnes:
  - title: Another Day in Paradise
    artist: Phil Collins
    notes:
      - "The final #1 hit of the '80s, can Phil Collins deliver?"
      - "...yes he can! This is probably his best #1 hit song; it's a song about the homeless, and he knocks it out of the park"
      - The spooky intro with that reverberated snare is just perfect
      - That laid back rhythm with those synth leads are amazing; real sets the mood for the song
      - I really like those subtle acoustic guitar bits throughout; so nice to listen to
  - title: How Am I Supposed to Live Without You
    artist: Michael Bolton
    notes:
      - "\"Michael Bolton? Like the pop singer? What's your favorite song of his?\""
      - "\"I dunno... I guess I sort of like 'em all.\""
      - "\"I celebrate the guy's entire catalogue!\""
      - If you haven't seen the movie "Office Space" you need to do that immediately
      - Anyway, this is a cover of a love ballad from 1983; originally done by Laura Branigan
      - It's okay I guess; nothing too special
  - title: Opposites Attract
    artist: Paula Abdul with The Wild Pair
    notes:
      - Abdul pairs up with a hip-hop duo on this one
      - It's really funky; solid work with the drum machine and synths
      - Honestly, The Wild Pair is better half of this song; Abdul's peroformance feels phoned-in
      - That's not saying much though; The Wild Pair is kinda cheesy during the rap parts
  - title: Escapade
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - That drone in the background is kinda spooky during the intro
      - The pre-chorus and chorus are pretty solid; especially with those stacked vocals
      - I'm surprised. I thought Janet Jackson would just be another standard female pop singer from this era, but her songs have a bit of an edge; I like it
  - title: Black Velvet
    artist: Alannah Myles
    notes:
      - Bluesy rock song about Elvis Presley
      - That rhythm is so down-lown and filthy; I love it
      - Solid vocal performance from Myles, I really like the chorus too!
      - Great guitar solo in the middle
  - title: Love Will Lead You Back
    artist: Taylor Dayne
    notes:
      - Slow love ballad
      - It's okay; the performace from Dayne is good for the most part, but the song is pretty bog standard
  - title: I'll Be Your Everything
    artist: Tommy Page
    notes:
      - Another slow love ballad
      - This one's even more underwhelming than the last; hardly an passion in this one
  - title: Nothing Compares 2 U
    artist: Sinéad O'Connor
    notes:
      - My God, THREE slow love ballads in a row! 1990 just won't let up, will it?
      - Actually, this one's REAL good! It's written by Prince and performed by an Irish artist
      - That synth chord progression is great; very angelic sounding
      - When those drums come in; it's just soooo good; The beat is basic but effective
      - Great vocal performace by O'Connor and those backing vocals are chilling
  - title: Vogue
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - "This is probably our first '90s dance song #1 hit; it basically sounds exactly like you think it does"
      - I really like the bassline under the mix
      - Can't say I like the rap verse towards the end; it's just so forced
      - This is one of those "Greatest songs of the '90s" you see on countdown lists, and I really don't see why. Sorry, but this ain't it, chief
  - title: Hold On
    artist: Wilson Phillips
    notes:
      - Pop rock ballad
      - This one's just real boring and forgettable; can't say much else
  - title: It Must Have Been Love
    artist: Roxette
    notes:
      - Another pop rock ballad
      - This one's okay; really nothing too special about this one
  - title: Step by Step
    artist: New Kids On The Block
    notes:
      - This one's nice and upbeat
      - It's nice to hear a song that isn't slow and boring, but this song is also nothing too special; it just kind of drags on
      - I guess the "Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc." vocal lines are unique with each singer taking a turn
  - title: She Ain't Worth It
    artist: Glenn Medeiros feat. Bobby Brown
    notes:
      - New Jack Swing song, Bobby Brown returns; can he live up to his last hit?
      - ...not really. This one's okay, but it really lacks that punch that "My Prerogative" has. Also, he's only a feature on this song, so probably he had very little to do with this one
  - title: Vision of Love
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - "Here we go; first Mariah Carey #1 hit of God knows how many in her career"
      - Solid vocal performance on this one; her voice really carries the song
      - My God, she's got one hell of a register; really hitting those high, high notes!
  - title: If Wishes Came True
    artist: Sweet Sensation
    notes:
      - This is another case of "slow, boring, nothing too special"
      - I guess the guitar solo's okay
  - title: Blaze Of Glory
    artist: Jon Bon Jovi
    notes:
      - "First and only #1 hit for Jon Bon Jovi as a solo artist"
      - Sort of a hard rock/blue rock song; I like the low tuning on the bass. It really adds a punch to the pre-verses
      - Chorus is okay; It's probably the more recognizable part of the song, but everything around it is much better
      - Not a half-bad guitar solo
  - title: Release Me
    artist: Wilson Phillips
    notes:
      - "Very similar to their last #1 hit; I will say this one's a little bit better, not nearly as boring, and better performed"
      - Good vocal harmonies during the chorus
  - title: (Can't Live Without Your) Love and Affection
    artist: Nelson
    notes:
      - Glam metal song
      - Oh shit, is that an acoustic 12-string guitar I hear? Okay, that knocks this one up a notch or two
      - I really like that chorus; it kind of reminds me of "Take Me Home Tonight" by Eddie Money
      - Not a half-bad guitar solo too!
  - title: Close To You
    artist: Maxi Priest
    notes:
      - Song by English Reggae artist; more of an R&B song
      - It's got a really solid rhythm section; very upbeat
      - It's an okay song; nothing too special about it
  - title: Praying for Time
    artist: George Michael
    notes:
      - Michael's performace is good, but the song itself kind of drags on for nearly 5 minutes; barely any changes throughout the whole song
      - Hell, even the verses and choruses sound the same
  - title: I Don't Have the Heart
    artist: James Ingram
    notes:
      - Slow R&B ballad
      - Not a bad performace from Ingram, but it's very repetitive
      - I guess I like the use of strings in the song; those are nice to hear
  - title: Black Cat
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - Whoa, is this a METAL song?!
      - Well, it's basically Janet Jackson, but with a metal guitar
      - The main guitar riff is very tasty; especially when they hit those pinch harmonics. So good!
      - Very good chorus; solid work from all involved
      - Great guitar solo too! Kind of reminds me of the guitar solo from "Beat It" from her brother Michael
  - title: Ice Ice Baby
    artist: Vanilla Ice
    notes:
      - 'This is the first "official" hip-hop song to reach #1, at least according to Billboard magazine'
      - Shamelessly stole the bassline from "Under Pressure" by Queen & David Bowie with no credit to them
      - The melody and rhythm are top-notch; but the lyrics and delivery from Vanilla Ice is so comical; it's like a parody of a rap song instead of an actual rap song
      - I can guarantee that Vanilla Ice has NEVER done any of the criminal activity he brags about in this song
      - 'If you want to listen to a good Vanilla Ice song, you should check out the "Ninja Rap", written for the film "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze". At least that song is tongue-in-cheek!'
  - title: Love Takes Time
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Slow R&B ballad
      - Another case of "slow and boring but the singer makes up for it with their talent"
  - title: I'm Your Baby Tonight
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - An upbeat minor-key R&B song
      - It nice to see Houston growing a bit of an edge to her songs
      - Great vocal performace from Houston, as always
      - However, this song really isn't anything too special; It's refreshing to hear, but don't get too excited
  - title: Because I Love You (The Postman Song)
    artist: Stevie B
    notes:
      - Slow pop ballad
      - "My God, I'm gonna fall asleep listening to this; How the hell was this at #1 for FOUR weeks!?"
