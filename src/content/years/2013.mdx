commentary: "We did it! We survived the \"Loudness War\"! Bravo! A pretty good year overall; well-produced, well-performed, and quite creative. This was probably the single-most creative year for #1 hit songs, which is saying something. I mean, the '60s are long gone but we got artists here in 2013 exploring some cool ideas!"
year: 2013
numberOnes:
  - title: Locked Out Of Heaven
    artist: Bruno Mars
    notes:
      - Funk rock song
      - The "whoop whoop whoop whoop, ooh!" line that is repeated throughout the whole song is kinda tacky
      - The laid back rhythm is refreshing to hear
      - I really wish the chorus didn't have that electronic rhythm; I think it would sound better if it stuck to the dry instrumentation
      - Mars' vocals are top-notch on this one, I gotta admit
  - title: Thrift Shop
    artist: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis feat. Wanz
    notes:
      - Comedic hip hop song about thrifting; I remember when I first heard this, I thought it was some lost Beastie Boys song, but then realized it was very much NOT them
      - The new jack swing intro rhythm is pretty neat
      - I really like the main saxaphone line; very catchy
      - These lyrics are so hilarious; I like it when a artist doesn't take themselves to seriously
  - title: Harlem Shake
    artist: Baauer
    notes:
      - "Wow, our first instrumental #1 hit song since the '80s"
      - Oh wait... I distinctly remember this one. Senior year of high school; supposedly there was going to be a flash mob of people dancing to this song, but got shut down by the Vice Principle
      - It's a catchy club track, but I can't say I reminisce about this fad dance song. I mean, it's really nothing too special
  - title: When I Was Your Man
    artist: Bruno Mars
    notes:
      - Sad piano ballad
      - I remember this girl at my high school who covered this song on guitar for a talent show; it was really good, but she didn't win; she lost to another girl who did a cup-stacking & ukulele cover of "Sexy And I Know It" by LMFAO
      - It's a pretty good song; I think this is even better than most of the "classic" piano ballads of previous decades, by far
  - title: Just Give Me a Reason
    artist: Pink feat. Nate Ruess
    notes:
      - Another piano ballad; features the singer from fun.
      - Great piano composition and vocal performance by Pink
      - I like how the primal percussion is added during the first chorus
      - Ruess' feature is also on-point; great harmonization with Pink
  - title: Can't Hold Us
    artist: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis feat. Ray Dalton
    notes:
      - Solid string-section intro; does kind of drag on on for a minute though
      - Macklemore's flows are pretty solid; can't say much else though
      - The best part is the chorus sung by Ray Dalton; he's got a good voice and it's very motivating
      - The switch from strings to horns in the second half is a very creative composition choice
      - Great "na na na na" part towards the end; very singable
  - title: Blurred Lines
    artist: Robin Thicke feat. T.I. & Pharrell Williams
    notes:
      - "I friggin' HATE this song. Not because it's bad (It's actually very good) but because it kept \"Get Lucky\" by Daft Punk out of the #1 spot for the WHOLE DAMN SUMMER!"
      - Eerily similar to "Gotta Give It Up" by Marvin Gaye; so much so that the Marvin Gaye Estate sued and won against Thicke and company which I think is complete bullshit
      - Damn funky; Thicke's, T.I.'s, and Williams' verses are top-notch; great voices that suit the song very well
  - title: Roar
    artist: Katy Perry
    notes:
      - Big, huge power pop anthem; references "Eye Of The Tiger" by Survivor and "We Are The Champions" by Queen
      - Great chorus; very catchy and singable
      - Solid vocal performance by Perry; she's also got great vocal cadence on this one
  - title: Wrecking Ball
    artist: Miley Cyrus
    notes:
      - This one's got an '80s pop feel to it; almost like a Bonnie Tyler or Sheena Easton song
      - Great vocal control by Cyrus; solid range
      - I like the "4-chords" chorus; very catchy
  - title: Royals
    artist: Lorde
    notes:
      - "Minimalistic indie pop song; youngest solo female artist to score a #1 hit song; Lorde being 16 years old at the time of recording."
      - "Damn, she's younger than I am! I guess that makes this the first #1 hit song by someone who was born after August 10th, 1995"
      - I really like the reverb over the whole song; very pleasant
      - Catchy chorus and I love those vocal harmonies throughout the song
      - "This is probably the best soul #1 hit song I've heard since the '60s"
  - title: The Monster
    artist: Eminem feat. Rihanna
    notes:
      - Great chorus by Rihanna; I think this one's better than the last one they did together
      - Eminem with a solid performance; neat lyrics too
      - Just a great song, overall; not much else to say
