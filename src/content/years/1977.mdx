year: 1977
numberOnes:
  - title: Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)
    artist: Rod Stewart
    notes:
      - Swingy soft rock song
      - Has a nice sax solo in the middle
      - It's a decent song; nothing too special about it
  - title: You Don't Have to Be a Star (To Be in My Show)
    artist: Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr.
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo disco duet
      - The two are really good singers; happy for them having been married for over 50 years
      - I like the little vocal bits in the middle; well harmonized
      - It's not bad; it's done well enough but it's nothing too special
  - title: You Make Me Feel Like Dancing
    artist: Leo Sayer
    notes:
      - Cheery disco song
      - This dude's got one hell of a falsetto
      - Chorus is catchy enough
  - title: I Wish
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    notes:
      - Insanely upbeat funk song
      - The tambre of the synth, electric piano, and bass being played together is pure ecstacy
      - The walking bass line is just great; wish it was more songs from this time
      - That chorus is so powerful!
  - title: Car Wash
    artist: Rose Royce
    notes:
      - That bass intro with those little guitar stabs are fantastic!
      - Great chorus; very singable
      - Besides that, the song is funky but it's nothing too special
  - title: Torn Between Two Lovers
    artist: Mary MacGregor
    notes:
      - Soft pop-rock song about a love triangle
      - The vocal performance here is putting me to sleep; no real passion at all
      - Also, the production quality is garbage; it sounds like it was recorded from an AM radio station
  - title: Blinded by the Light
    artist: Manfred Mann's Earth Band
    notes:
      - Rock song written by Bruce Springsteen
      - Great electric organ work on this one
      - Okay, does anybody know what this song's about? The lyrics are so incoherent, I have no clue
      - I guess if you rock hard enough, your song doesn't have to make sense! XD
  - title: New Kid in Town
    artist: The Eagles
    notes:
      - Slow soft rock song
      - Great guitar lead guitar work throughout the song
      - Nice outro; the vocals are pretty good
      - It's a well-done song, but it's just a little boring for my liking
  - title: Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star is Born)
    artist: Barbra Streisand
    notes:
      - Love ballad
      - I like the arpeggiated chords on the acoustic guitar; much better than most other ballads I've heard so far
      - Streisand's vocals on this one pretty good; a nice wide range also!
      - Not half bad; I was expecting a slow, sappy, ballad but it actually sounds pretty good
  - title: Rich Girl
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    notes:
      - Nice chorus; fits well with the electric piano chords
      - "First time I've heard the word \"bitch\" in a #1 hit; can't wait until we get to the 2010s!"
      - Nice little mid-tempo funky song; I like it
  - title: Dancing Queen
    artist: ABBA
    notes:
      - Europop disco song
      - Somehow one of the better disco groups came from Sweden of all places
      - Amazing vocal performance and instrumentation; it just radiates wonder
      - Honestly, this is just a great song; it's probably the closest thing to a "perfect" disco song
  - title: Don't Give Up on Us
    artist: David Soul
    notes:
      - Soft rock piano ballad
      - Largely forgettable; It's pretty much indistinguishable from everything else so far
  - title: Don't Leave Me This Way
    artist: Thelma Houston
    notes:
      - Originally going to be a Diana Ross song, but was assigned to Houston
      - The chorus is actually pretty good; better than Diana Ross' other songs so far honestly
      - Actually, after thinking about it, I think I like Houston's voice better than Ross' O_O
  - title: Southern Nights
    artist: Glen Campbell
    notes:
      - Pop-country song; has a bit of a ragtimey feel to it
      - Very upbeat and catchy
      - I like the little guitar riff that plays after each chorus
      - Just a great song; can't complain
  - title: Hotel California
    artist: The Eagles
    notes:
      - Latin/Reggae rock song about Los Angeles
      - Great storytelling on this one; great lyrics
      - Amazing chorus; the reggae feel to it is just perfect
      - I cannot understate how legendary the double guitar solo by Don Felder and Joe Walsh is here; it's amazing!
  - title: When I Need You
    artist: Leo Sayer
    notes:
      - Slow love song
      - Chorus is pretty good
      - A nice pleasant sax solo as well
      - Not half-bad honestly
  - title: Sir Duke
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    notes:
      - Amazing horn section on this one
      - The decending bit right before the chorus is amazing
      - The chorus is the kind of thing that brightens up your day no matter what
  - title: I'm Your Boogie Man
    artist: KC & The Sunshine Band
    notes:
      - I'm honestly impressed. They've managed to write a song that sounds distinct from their other hits!
      - Those horns are fantastic; sounds bad-ass!
      - Also an awesome chorus as well; "I'm your boogie man, boogie man..."
      - Oooooh, that little guitar and piano solo in the middle is great!
  - title: Dreams
    artist: Fleetwood Mac
    notes:
      - That foreboding bass line... chilling
      - Those fade-in guitar notes throughout the whole song are just ethreal... amazing
      - Those haunting vocals from Stevie Nicks are just perfect
      - When those backing vocals come in during the chorus; it just sends the song into the clouds
      - If you haven't heard the album "Rumours" yet, you need to do that; amazing album
  - title: Got To Give It Up Pt. 1
    artist: Marvin Gaye
    notes:
      - An amazing funky R&B song; even this late in the game, Marvin Gaye still had it!
      - I actually like how it mixed to sound like it's being recorded at a house party
      - It's not a song that takes itself too seriously; it's just a solid grove!
  - title: Gonna Fly Now (Theme From Rocky)
    artist: Bill Conti
    notes:
      - Philly soul song written for the boxing film Rocky
      - Those horns drive the song like a Mack Truck
      - When the backing vocals come in, it elevates the song so well
      - There's even a damn good guitar solo in the middle too!
  - title: Undercover Angel
    artist: Alan O'Day
    notes:
      - This is such a tacky song; the call-response bit before the chorus sounds like it's ripped straight from a parody song
      - The reverb on the vocals really drive home the tackyness of the song
      - There's even some Fisher-Price toy instruments in it too!
  - title: Da Doo Ron Ron
    artist: Shaun Cassidy
    notes:
      - Cover of an old doo-wop R&B song from 1963
      - Honestly, the '70s production quality makes it sound like a lame ass karaoke cover
  - title: Looks Like We Made It
    artist: Barry Manilow
    notes:
      - Slow piano ballad
      - It's at least one notch better than Manilow's other ballads, I think
      - ...but they just had to throw in a needless key change near the end
  - title: I Just Want to Be Your Everything
    artist: Andy Gibb
    notes:
      - Hey, everyone look! It's the Bee Gees Jr. (literally the younger brother of the two Gibb brothers in the Bee Gees)!
      - Joking aside, this is actually a pretty solid disco song
      - Andy Gibb gives a pretty good vocal performace on this song
      - It's surprisingly restrained for a disco song; it doesn't go too overboard (besides maybe the string section)
  - title: Best of My Love
    artist: The Emotions
    notes:
      - A nice little upbeat funky/disco song
      - It's a well-done song and it's catchy and all, but the fact that it's overplayed on the radio just kills it for me
  - title: Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band
    artist: Meco
    notes:
      - "\"Hey, let's take two most popular things in America, Star Wars and disco, and combined them!\" The Song"
      - Somehow it actually manages to sound pretty good
      - I just noticed that my song-progress bar on my Spotify is a lightsaber XD Neat little easter egg!
      - Honestly, I think the Cantina Band part of the medley is the better half
  - title: You Light Up My Life
    artist: Debby Boone
    notes:
      - '#1 for 10 consectutive weeks, beating the record held by "Hey Jude" by the Beatles by one week'
      - Really? I'm disappointed in you 1977 America; this is NOT the "Hey Jude" killer it should have been!
      - Just a slow, boring love song; it's not terrible, but it's far from something legendary
  - title: How Deep Is Your Love
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - Slow soft rock ballad
      - This actually pretty good; the vocals are fantastic throughout; especially during the chorus
      - Those synth chords are just nice and pleasant to listen to
