commentary: This was not a good year. There really wasn't anything that stood out; everything was just kind of bland and boring this year. Some good stuff here and there, but even then it's a far-cry to some of the previous year's stuff.
year: 1976
numberOnes:
  - title: Saturday Night
    artist: Bay City Rollers
    notes:
      - "'50s Rock N' Roll throwback song"
      - The "S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... hey!" bit is kind of catchy
      - Either than that, it's an okay song
  - title: Convoy
    artist: C.W. McCall
    notes:
      - Novelty country song about truck drivers
      - The chorus is catchy, but the high-pitched backup singers DO NOT fit the theme AT ALL; It's a country song, not a disco song
      - It's a funny song, you can tell they weren't taking it too seriously
  - title: I Write the Songs
    artist: Barry Manilow
    notes:
      - '"Mr. Manilow, you claim to WRITE the songs, yet you are singing a song written by someone else! Curious!"'
      - Okay, besides that lame joke, it's not a half-bad ballad. It's kind of a stock ballad, but I've heard worse
  - title: Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)
    artist: Diana Ross
    notes:
      - Theme song for the film of the same name
      - Meh, just a plain boring song; really nothing exciting about this one at all
  - title: Love Rollercoaster
    artist: Ohio Players
    notes:
      - Damn, that's one funky guitar riff!
      - Good backing vocals on this one
      - The song kind of drags on for 5 minutes, but then again this was made for the disco/club
  - title: 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover
    artist: Paul Simon
    notes:
      - Nice marching cadence to the song
      - Interesting chord progression; quite unconventional
      - The chorus is nice and funky
      - Funny lyrics
  - title: Theme from S.W.A.T.
    artist: Rhythm Heritage
    notes:
      - Instrumental theme for the TV Series of the same name
      - Insanely funky; that chord progression on piano is fantastic
      - The little breakdown in the middle with the bass is too damn good
  - title: Love Machine Pt. 1
    artist: The Miracles
    notes:
      - The main riff during the chorus is just great
      - Vocals are pretty good; especially during the chorus
      - Solid song; nothing to complain about
  - title: December, 1963 (Oh What a Night!)
    artist: Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons
    notes:
      - You know this one's not half bad; I guess you could say that these guys do disco better than doo-wop
      - Frankie actually sounds better when singing in this range; a lot better than his performance on "Big Girls Don't Cry"
      - The main riff is nice and upbeat
  - title: Disco Lady
    artist: Johnnie Taylor
    notes:
      - It's an okay disco song; it's probably the most stock-sounding disco song I've ever heard
      - The lyrics are so hilariously suggestive; I can't help but laugh at how silly they are
  - title: Let Your Love Flow
    artist: The Bellamy Brothers
    notes:
      - A nice upbeat pop-country song
      - Amazing chord progression
      - Very cheery lyrics; very singable
      - One of the best choruses I've heard so far
  - title: 'Welcome Back (Theme from Welcome Back, Kotter)'
    artist: John Sebastian
    notes:
      - Wow, 2 TV themes in one year? What a bargain!
      - It's a nice upbeat, cheery song
      - Maybe it's a little "too" cheery; it's kind of creepy how happy this sounds
      - Nice little blues harp solo in the middle
  - title: Boogie Fever
    artist: The Sylvers
    notes:
      - Nice analog synth and guitar main riff
      - Really silly lyrics, but it's whatever
      - '"Doing the bump, bump, bump!" bit is kind of catchy'
  - title: Silly Love Songs
    artist: Paul McCartney & Wings
    notes:
      - I really like the industrial park sounds in the beginning; kind of jarring but in a good way
      - Great bass on this track; stands out in the front of the mix
      - The horn section is on point; really good!
      - The backing vocals really compliment the track well
  - title: Love Hangover
    artist: Diana Ross
    notes:
      - Has a nice drum groove
      - The vocals are just too breathy and weird sounding
      - I kind of like how the song picks up the pace in the middle; makes a bit more funky
      - Either than that; nothing too special
  - title: Afternoon Delight
    artist: Starland Vocal Band
    notes:
      - Pop-country song
      - Nice vocal harmony throughout
      - It's a decent song; not bad
  - title: Kiss and Say Goodbye
    artist: The Manhattans
    notes:
      - The spoken-word intro is just sooooo melodramatic and boring
      - The main vocals are pretty decent; fits the groove well enough
  - title: Don't Go Breaking My Heart
    artist: Elton John & Kiki Dee
    notes:
      - Nice little funky duet
      - John and Dee sound pretty good together here
      - Nice chorus; very upbeat
      - Good instrumentation all throughout; top notch production quality
  - title: You Should Be Dancing
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - You know, when the Bee Gees go all-out with disco, they really do sound good
      - There's a nice sense of urgency with the song; a perfect fit for a disco/club
      - One hell of a guitar solo in the middle
  - title: (Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty
    artist: KC & The Sunshine Band
    notes:
      - It's like every hit song these guys had, they just slightly changed how the last one went and called it a day
      - It crazy how similar all of there songs sound
  - title: Play That Funky Music
    artist: Wild Cherry
    notes:
      - It's like they set out to write the funkiest song, and managed to do it
      - That main riff on bass is great
      - Awesome guitar solo!
  - title: A Fifth of Beethoven
    artist: Walter Murphy & The Big Apple Band
    notes:
      - Discofied version of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5
      - It's not like bad or anything, but they must've been high when they came up with this idea
  - title: Disco Duck
    artist: Rick Dees & His Cast of Idiots
    notes:
      - Novelty song satirizing disco
      - Okay, THESE people must of been high when they came up with this idea
      - I can't say I like the "duck" vocals; I mean they tried, but it's sounds horrible
      - I guess since it's a parody, I can't hate it all that much
  - title: If You Leave Me Now
    artist: Chicago
    notes:
      - Soft rock song
      - I've always kind of liked Chicago; they are quite a talented group
      - Even though this song is as perdictable as many other soft rock songs, I do thing this one's got a special charm to it
      - I really like the little acoustic guitar bits throughout
  - title: Rock'n Me
    artist: Steve Miller Band
    notes:
      - Nice, bluesy hard rock song
      - Lyrics have a nice rhythmic quality to them; I like it
      - I'm just thankful that we got some bluey music this year
  - title: Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)
    artist: Rod Stewart
    notes:
      - Swingy soft rock song
      - Has a nice sax solo in the middle
