commentary: This was an alright year, not terrible, but not super amazing either. I'm just glad the songs sound good now. No more bad mixing, no more bad production jobs. Of course the songs should be able to shine on their own, and some of these songs were a bit of a miss for me.
year: 2014
numberOnes:
  - title: The Monster
    artist: Eminem feat. Rihanna
    notes:
      - Great chorus by Rihanna; I think this one's better than the last one they did together
      - Eminem with a solid performance; neat lyrics too
      - Just a great song, overall; not much else to say
  - title: Timber
    artist: Pitbull feat. Kesha
    notes:
      - EDM club song with a western country feel
      - Kesha's attempt at a southern accent is laughable; Kesha... you're from LA
      - Pitbull's flow is fairly solid, but it's really nothing to special
      - Meh, the whole song is kinda boring if you ask me
  - title: Dark Horse
    artist: Kate Perry feat. Juicy J
    notes:
      - The rap call-out in the intro is pretty tacky; why do rapper do that?
      - I like the maion synth line; very mystic and spooky
      - Lyrics are a bit confusing, does Katy Perry even know what a "Dark Horse" is?
      - The build-up during the chorus to that "There's no goin' back" drop is pretty neat; very subtle and not over the top
      - Juicy J's verse is so hilarious; I feel like he should have worked on those lyrics a bit more; "She'll eat your heart out... like Jeffrey Dahmer!"
  - title: Happy
    artist: Pharrell Williams
    notes:
      - Soul song; written for the film "Dispicable Me 2"
      - Well, it is indeed a very "happy" song; extremely upbeat
      - I love the clap-breakdown in the middle and towards the end; very catchy and great
      - It's a good song, but I do feel like it drags on for too long; maybe shave off a chorus or add another verse
  - title: All of Me
    artist: John Legend
    notes:
      - Piano ballad; literally just Legend's voice and his piano
      - Very somber piano chord-progression; I like it
      - Legend's voice is on-point here; very soaring
      - Great lyrics; simple and effective
      - I like how we get those stacked vocals towards the end, adds a nice bit of flavor to the song
  - title: Fancy
    artist: Iggy Azalea feat. Charli XCX
    notes:
      - That simple beat is pretty good, I must admit; I like a song with a minimal feel to it
      - Feels a lot like "Like a G6"; it's all about the excesses of being a rapper; it is a bit weird that this White Aussie girl is rapping about being a "murderah"
      - Charli XCX's vocal performance on the chorus is pretty solid; also the bridge is pretty good too
  - title: Rude
    artist: Magic!
    notes:
      - A... reggae song? Wow, that's a bit of an anomoly
      - Honestly this song's lyrics are just so boring and whiny; dude... why do you want her dad's blessing? Just marry her already! She isn't his property!
      - I do kinda like the guitar solo; kinda reminds me of Prince a bit
  - title: Shake It Off
    artist: Taylor Swift
    notes:
      - Upbeat dance pop song
      - The chorus is pretty catchy; I like how each line decends down the Major Scale
      - The bridge is kinda of a silly ode to "Hey Mickey" by Toni Basil; I guess I like it
  - title: All About That Bass
    artist: Meghan Trainor
    notes:
      - Another Bubblegum pop revival song with a hip hop tingle; this time it's a fat-acceptance song!
      - Very clever lyrics; kinda aggressive, but is ultimately a postive-minded song
      - Kinda wished they actually committed to the principle of the song when making the music video; I would NOT call any of the backup dancers or even Trainor herself over-weight AT ALL
  - title: Blank Space
    artist: Taylor Swift
    notes:
      - Very minimal pop song; simple beat with a subtle synth
      - Really love the composition of the song, the way that the verse flows into the chorus, and the way the chorus leads into the post-chorus; very well done
      - Great bridge; gotta love those stacked vocals
      - Just a really well-made pop song; Swift and company really gave it their all on this one
