commentary: This was probably the most "meh" year so far. Even the really good stuff was just okay compared to the previous year's good stuff. However, it wasn't a bad year, I would mind hearing most of these again.

  - position: 1
    title: Brand New Key
    artist: Melanie
    notes:
      - A very cheery folk song
      - This chick rollerskates everwhere doesn't she?
      - The vocals on this one are insane; it sounds like she's going to burst into tears any second
  - position: 2
    title: American Pie
    artist: Don McLean
    notes:
      - Amazing folk song about "The Day The Music Died" February 3, 1959. Quite a tragic day for Rock N' Roll
      - Each verse is like a vignette loaded with metaphors. It's a little artsy, but really does a good job of capturing the feeling people had on that day
      - Probably the single most singable chorus ever written
      - A pop song is usually 3 minutes or so long, but this manages to break that trend at over 8 and a half minutes long. Impressive!
  - position: 3
    title: Let's Stay Together
    artist: Al Green
    notes:
      - This is an amazing song; the performance is so restrained which really makes it feel more like Green is talking directly to you
      - The galloping beat behind the song is just great; it somehow gels well with the vocal performance
      - Of course you can't have an outstanding soul song without horns!
  - position: 4
    title: Without You
    artist: Harry Nilsson
    notes:
      - That one song everybody think Mariah Carey did originally. Funny enough, this is also a cover
      - Probably my favorite songwriter of all time; it's a shame he never got the level of stardom as some of his contemporaries
      - An amazing performace from Nilsson here, but it's far from his best work. I'd recommend checking out his other songs
  - position: 5
    title: Heart of Gold
    artist: Neil Young
    notes:
      - A folk rock classic; so gritty and heavy sounding. Neil Young is probably the main inspiration for a lot of the rock and metal we'd hear years later
      - Great harmonica work on this one; the icing on the cake!
      - The mixing on this song makes it sound like it was done yesterday. It's so good!
  - position: 6
    title: A Horse with No Name
    artist: America
    notes:
      - America were really great songwriters, but I can't help but laugh that their most lyrically incoherent song was their most popular
      - Either than that, this is an amazing song. That open tuning on the 12-string guitar, those vocal harmonies, that light reverb over the whole song; just amazing
  - position: 7
    title: The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face
    artist: Roberta Flack
    notes:
      - A slow jazz song dtiven by the vocals
      - The soft acoustic guitar play well off the vocals
      - Very well done, at no point does it go overboard, it's simple yet powerful
  - position: 8
    title: Oh Girl
    artist: The Chi-Lites
    notes:
      - Very reminiscent of the R&B from the '50s but still distinctly '70s sounding
      - Another well done song; everything sounds good together
      - I do think the melodica sounds a little tacky, at least from the this era
  - position: 10
    title: I'll Take You There
    artist: The Staple Singers
    notes:
      - A nice little laid-back funk song
      - The guitar/harmonica solo is great
      - The heavy-breathing vocals are little distracting; it's not like she's trying to be sexy, it's more like she's out of breathing
  - position: 11
    title: The Candy Man
    artist: Sammy Davis Jr.
    notes:
      - "It took quite a while for this Rat-Pack singer to get a #1 hit"
      - This was written for Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory... it's about the candy man
      - Kind of a silly little song, but it fits the score for the film well enough
  - position: 12
    title: Song Sung Blue
    artist: Neil Diamond
    notes:
      - A nice, very swingy song
      - The organ and horn sections are very well done
      - A good song, but it kind of drags on a bit
  - position: 13
    title: Lean on Me
    artist: Bill Withers
    notes:
      - Song about being there for a friend
      - Those iconic piano chords; too good!
      - Very singable
      - Simple, yet effective
  - position: 14
    title: '"Alone Again (Naturally)'
    artist: Gilbert O'Sullivan
    notes:
      - "I think this is the first #1 from an Irish artist (an ACTUAL Irish person from Ireland)"
      - It's a nice little song about loneliness; nice piano chords
      - I really like that classical guitar solo in the middle
      - It's a good song, but there's nothing too special about it
  - position: 15
    title: "\"Brandy (You're a Find Girl)"
    artist: Looking Glasses
    notes:
      - I like the "do do do do do" backing vocals, but the main vocals sound weird
      - It's an okay song, kind of wish there was more to it
  - position: 16
    title: Black And White
    artist: Three Dog Night
    notes:
      - A song about the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision
      - Honestly, this song is really lame. For a political song, it really lacks that "get up and fight!" energy; it's almost like a lullaby
  - position: 17
    title: Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me
    artist: Mac Davis
    notes:
      - Easy-listening song with a bit of a country vibe to it
      - I would say it sounds generic, but supposedly Davis' record told him to write a song with a "hook" so he made this. It's almost like a parody of a pop song in a way!
      - Can't rank to high though, it still is just a middle-of-the-road song
  - position: 18
    title: Ben
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - "First #1 from Michael Jackson as a solo artist"
      - Made for the film of the same name; it's about a boy who befriends a rat named Ben
      - It's an okay song, funny enough it's Jackson's performance that makes it better. Otherwise it'd be pretty generic I think
  - position: 19
    title: My Ding-a-Ling
    artist: Chuck Berry
    notes:
      - A live performance of a song about... a set of silver bells on a string
      - WTF America? This is what you were listening to 1972?
      - I guess it's a silly enough song, but I just can't get over how this was the most popular song at one point. This is the kind of thing you put at the end of an album as a bonus track
      - I think the one redeeming factor is just how much fun Chuck Berry is having with the audience here
  - position: 20
    title: I Can See Clearly Now
    artist: Johnny Nash
    notes:
      - Not to be confused with Johnny Cash
      - A nice little happy song; I love the chorus
      - Hell, there's even a honest-to-God accordion in this song, and it sounds good!
      - Also an amazing Bridge section; outstanding vocal harmonies!
  - position: 21
    title: Papa Was a Rollin' Stone
    artist: The Tempatations
    notes:
      - Amazing intro; That scratchy wah-pedal guitar, that bassline, that string section... so damn funky!
      - Great vocal performace from everyone
      - Those little reverberated trumpet solos after the choruses are great
  - position: 22
    title: I Am a Woman
    artist: Helen Reddy
    notes:
      - Folky feminist anthem
      - very upbeat and catchy
      - It's a good song, but it's a little too on the nose but I imagine
  - position: 23
    title: Me and Mrs. Jones
    artist: Billy Paula
    notes:
      - A nice little soul song about an affair
      - Very dreamy and ethreal sounding
      - Great vocal performance; especially when the band stops to let Paula sing
