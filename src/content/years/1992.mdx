commentary: 'Wow, okay. I guess Americans in 1992 didn''t get too bored of the same song that much. Only 13 songs this year reached #1; it took me less than an hour to listen to all of these! I really wish I could say this was a good or bad year, but I really can''t since there just wasn''t enough #1 hits to make a decision. If I had a "good", "meh", and "bad" tier-list for this project, 1992 would go into the "I dunno" catagory.'
year: 1992
numberOnes:
  - title: Black or White
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - Song celebrating interracial relationships/racial harmony
      - Insanely catchy; especially with that guitar riff and Michael's vocal cadence
      - Holy shit, that breakdown in the middle is so damn heavy! and it came out of nowhere!
      - It's insane how after nearly three decades, Michael Jackson managed to change with the times and write really good songs to fit those times
  - title: All 4 Love
    artist: Color Me Badd
    notes:
      - Very upbeat; sounds like it's influenced from the early motown and '60s pop
      - Great vocal harmonies from all involved
      - Just a good, happy song; not a single grey cloud on this one
  - title: Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me
    artist: George Michael & Elton John
    notes:
      - Song originally written and recorded by John in 1974; first performed with Michael at Live Aid in 1985, and then again for this single in 1991
      - Michael takes over on lead vocals for this one; For the most part his voice is faithful to the original performed by John
      - I mean, it's basically indistinguishable from the original, barring the obvious inclusion of Michael
      - It's a good song; not much else to say
  - title: I'm Too Sexy
    artist: Right Said Fred
    notes:
      - British Dance pop song
      - Very tongue-in-cheek; They clearly weren't taking themselves too seriously on this song
      - That "I do my little turn on the catwalk!" lyric is friggin' hilarious; too funny to not laugh at
      - Besides the novelty factor, it's just a well-made dance song; doesn't go on for too long and his interesting the whole time
  - title: To Be With You
    artist: Mr. Big
    notes:
      - 'Even this late in the game, we were still getting glam rock bands doing love ballads and reaching #1'
      - By the way, the guitarist for this band, Paul Glibert, is a pretty cool dude and like.... REALLY good at guitar
      - Great chorus; very singable and catchy
      - Another honest-to-God acoustic guitar solo!
  - title: Save The Best For Last
    artist: Vanessa Williams
    notes:
      - Slow pop ballad
      - No, this is NOT the pro tennis player
      - Meh, slow boring song; nothing really special about it
  - title: Jump
    artist: Kris Kross
    notes:
      - 'First G-Funk/Rap #1 hit; song done by two adolescent boys'
      - It's got all of the staples of a G-Funk or Gangsta Rap song from the '90s, but it's very G-rated and kid-friendly
      - I will say, they are pretty good. It's a solid song with good flows and performances
  - title: I'll Be There
    artist: Mariah Carey feat. Trey Lorenz
    notes:
      - 'Cover of the Jackson 5 #1 hit from 1970'
      - I actually like this one much better then the original. The '90s R&B aesthetic fits this song much better
      - Besides Carey's great vocal performance, Lorenz's vocals also knocks it out of the park as well!
  - title: Baby Got Back
    artist: Sir Mix-a-Lot
    notes:
      - Rap song about big butts
      - The valley-girl intro is so tacky; also she's racist as hell haha (I know, it's joke)
      - It's so in-your-face with the lyrics that it actually makes it amazing; There's absolutely no subtlety here. and I love it
      - I'm absolutely floored by the amount of creative ways one could say they like large asses; I never heard this song past the intro until now
      - Oh yeah, and the song's composition is great too
  - title: This Used to Be My Playground
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - Song written for the baseball film "A League of Their Own"
      - Nothing much to see here folks; just another slow, boring pop song that drags on for too long
  - title: End Of the Road
    artist: Boyz II Men
    notes:
      - 'This monster of a song was #1 for 13 consecutive weeks; breaking the previous record held by "Physical" by Olivia Newton-John by 4 weeks! Wow, so does it stack up?'
      - ...it absolutely does. Ladies and Gentlemen... THIS is how you do an all-singer R&B group. Buttery smooth harmonies, great chord progressions, a nice variety of vocal timbre between each singer, and powerful deliveries from all
      - That pre-chorus is just amazing; it builds up to one hell of a chorus
      - I will say, the premise of this song is so weird... like dude, just dump her and move on. She isn't going to be loyal to you.
  - title: How Do You Talk to an Angel
    artist: The Heights
    notes:
      - Pop rock song; TV theme for the short-lived show "The Heights"
      - Alright, if you are going to make a TV theme, it needs to be exciting and upbeat. This dawdling, mid-tempo song can't decide if it wants to be happy or sad
  - title: I Will Always Love You
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - Originally written by Dolly Parton in 1973; this cover was recorded for the film "The Bodyguard"
      - 'Okay, that didn''t take long. This song was at #1 for 14 consecutive weeks, beating out "The End Of the Road" by just 1 week. Does THIS stack up?'
      - ...eh, not really. I know this is going against the grain, but this song's just "meh". It's basically just a standard slow pop ballad, but it does have that insane key-change where she goes "and IIIIIIIIIII" which is quite impressive vocally, but that's really the only memorable part
