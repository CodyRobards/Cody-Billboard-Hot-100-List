numberOnes:
  - title: Don't Forget About Us
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Oh no, Mariah don't!
      - Dang, she fell for the "slow boring '00s R&B sound"...
      - Well, I guess I can't say that the song's bad since it's Carey singing; her voice tends to salt the song to palatable status
      - Eh, I guess it's okay enough
  - title: Laffy Taffy
    artist: D4L
    notes:
      - Crunk song; actually it's a sub-genre of Crunk called "Snap" I guess it's a more minimal and stripped down version of Crunk
      - Jesus christ, the beat and vocal performances are so obnoxious. Something tells me that these guys took this one completely seriously and didn't think to re-do this one
      - That chorus is so cheesy; it's like they were like "we need a phrase that means 'ass', what sounds good? Wait, I know! How 'bout Laffy Taffy?!"
      - Garbage lyrics; not funny or clever at all
  - title: Grillz
    artist: Nelly feat. Paul Wall, Ali & Gipp
    notes:
      - Solid beat; very commanding
      - The flows from everyone are also pretty solid; on-point and suit the song well
      - The lyrics are a little silly, but it really doesn't take away from the song all that much
      - Besides the cheesy chorus, it's a decent song
  - title: Check on It
    artist: Beyoncé feat. Bun B & Slim Thug
    notes:
      - The woodwind drone in the background is kind of annoying; it really drags the song out
      - Surprisingly good vocal performace by Beyoncé, and the two feature's rap flows are also pretty decent too
      - Meh, it's an alright song overall
  - title: You're Beautiful
    artist: James Blunt
    notes:
      - Wow, a folky pop rock song; that's refreshing... and it's also a "4-Chords" song!
      - The composition is pretty good; nice and bright-sounding
      - Blunt's vocal performance is alright; some funny lyrical choices, but that's fine
      - It's a good song, but it's nothing too special
  - title: So Sick
    artist: Ne-Yo
    notes:
      - Usher copy-cat song
      - I guess it's a bit better than your typical Usher; Ne-Yo's voice is a lot better
      - It's really nothing special, but I guess it's pleasant to listen to
  - title: Temperature
    artist: Sean Paul
    notes:
      - Upbeat dancehall song
      - "Much better than Paul's last #1 hits; much better composed and performed"
      - Catchy chorus
      - I really can't picture this outside of a danceclub; it drags on for too long and there's not a whole lot to this song
  - title: Bad Day
    artist: Daniel Powter
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo piano pop ballad
      - Great composition; especially that piano
      - Powter's voice is also on-point here; solid chops
      - Very catchy chorus; signable
      - Not a half-bad bridge section; It's refreshing to hear a decent key-change for once
  - title: SOS
    artist: Rihanna
    notes:
      - 'The first of 14 #1 hits for the Barbadian singer; this one samples "Tainted Love" by Soft Cell'
      - I would say that this is a grea use of the Tainted Love sample; it keeps the same upbeat and lively feel of the song
      - I really like that chorus; very catchy
      - Rihanna's vocal performace here is pretty good; great control
  - title: Ridin'
    artist: Chamillionaire feat. Krayzie Bone
    notes:
      - Hip hop song; featuring former Bone Thugs-N-Harmony signer
      - That's one hell of a beat; another powerful large-in-charge composition
      - Outstanding flows by Chamillionaire, he's really on top of his game here, and the lyrics are pretty solid too
      - Very catchy chorus; "Try to catch me ridin' dirtyyyy!"
      - Bone's feature is equally comparible to Chamillionaire's verses... actually I think it's even better!
      - I was already prone to liking this song since "Weird Al" Yankovic did the "White & Nerdy" parody of this song
  - title: Hips Don't Lie
    artist: Shakira feat. Wyclef Jean
    notes:
      - Latin/reggaeton song; holds the record for "most played radio song in a single week" in America at 9,637 times
      - Bah, this reminds me too much of the sterile and clean "latin pop" of Ricky Martin; lacks the passion and realness of a proper song from Latin America
      - Also the autotune on Shakira's voice is way too obvious and robotic; but not the T-Pain kind of robotic, the "uncanny valley" kind of robotic
  - title: Do I Make You Proud
    artist: Taylor Hicks
    notes:
      - 'Chalk up another "American Idol" contestant #1 hit; slow pop ballad'
      - It has the exact same chord progression of "I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing" by Aerosmith; I never realized how influencial that song was to '00s music...
      - Meh, I guess it's okay; Hicks' voice is pretty solid but the song is pretty bog-standard for a pop ballad
  - title: Promiscuous
    artist: Nelly Furtado feat. Timbaland
    notes:
      - "Wow, a love duet #1 hit... first of the decade I think"
      - The call-response of the two singers is pretty neat I think
      - Great chorus; solid vocal peroformance
      - Great song overall
  - title: London Bridge
    artist: Fergie
    notes:
      - "Fergie of Black Eyed Peas fame, scoring her first #1 hit as a solo artist"
      - That "Oh, shit!" backing lyric is too damn funny
      - Honestly, the vocal performance by Fergie is really whiney; especially during the chorus
      - I will say, the production and mixing are really good; if only someone other than Fergie sang on it...
  - title: SexyBack
    artist: Justin Timberlake
    notes:
      - Electro-R&B song
      - That beat is so damn catchy and well-done; very funky!
      - Great vocals by Timberlake and company; really suits the song well
      - I love that "take it to the fridge/chorus!" line
      - I never thought a boy band singer could evolve into this, I guess that better than most
  - title: Money Maker
    artist: Ludacris feat. Pharrell
    notes:
      - A hip hop reimagining of the 1961 song "Shake Your Moneymaker" by Elmore James
      - Real cheesy lyrics by Ludacris, I guess that part of the aesthetic, but I can't help but think his tough-rapper persona fits an edgier style
  - title: My Love
    artist: Justin Timberlake feat. T.I.
    notes:
      - Really like those spacey synth chords that drive the song
      - Okay, Timberlake is back to his boy band roots on this one; his falsetto is alright, but not amazing
      - T.I.'s feature is not half-bad, but it's noth enough to make this song that much better
  - title: I Wanna Love You
    artist: Akon feat. Snoop Dogg
    notes:
      - Wow, okay this is literally the most on-the-nose song about sex. The actual name of the song is "I Wanna Fuck You", but I guess it had to be renamed for radio play
      - Akon's voice is so nasally and high-pitched; not really all that great
      - Snoop Dogg's really is going at it on this one; he's got no shame with his verses!
      - I can't believe a song that's this sexual can be so dawdling and boring; They should have got Sir Mix-a-Lot in the studio, he would have done this song justice!
  - title: Irreplaceable
    artist: Beyoncé
    notes:
      - I always thought this song was called "To the left, To the left!" for some reason...
      - I really like the acoustic guitar chord-progression; it really serves the song so well
      - Amazing vocal performance by Beyoncé; there's so much breadth to her voice here and she knocks it out of the park
      - Besides, the "Yaasss Gurrllll... Boss Queen!" energy, it's a fantastic song
