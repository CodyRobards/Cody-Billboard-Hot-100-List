commentary: "Worst year so far. It's like the death throes of doo-wop and insincere cash-cows of the pre-British Invasion U.S. I'm surprised that the most enjoyable #1's this year were instrumentals, let alone a clarinet song being my most favorite."
year: 1962
numberOnes:
  - position: 1
    title: The Lion Sleeps Tonight
    artist: The Tokens
    notes:
      - The lyric "Oh-weem-ah-wep" as silly as it sounds is very singable
      - The lead vocal is very good, despite sounding very silly
      - Great Tenor Sax solo in the middle
  - position: 2
    title: The Twist
    artist: Chubby Checker
    notes:
      - Supposedly the dance craze came back just less than 2 years later and topped the chart again, amazing!
      - Literally the same song; not even re-recorded
  - position: 3
    title: Peppermint Twist
    artist: Joey Dee and the Starliters
    notes:
      - Another fad "dance" song to challenge "The Twist" believe it or not
      - Completely mindless but I guess it's catchy
  - position: 4
    title: Duke of Earl
    artist: Gene Chandler
    notes:
      - The "Duke of Earl" bass singer sounds so dopey
      - It really just feels like every doo-wop group was trying to write the same song at this time
  - position: 5
    title: Hey! Baby
    artist: Bruce Channel
    notes:
      - Somehow this song lasted long enough in the public sub-concious for it to end up being played by my High School band at football games
      - It's not too bad; this is the first harmonic I've heard so far
  - position: 6
    title: Don't Break the Heart That Loves You
    artist: Connie Francis
    notes:
      - Connie's is a good singer, but all of these songs of hers really do all sound the same
      - The spoken word section is fairly juvinille ("Don't break my heart like how a little child breaks a toy")
  - position: 7
    title: Johnny Angel
    artist: Shelley Fabares
    notes:
      - "\"OMG isn't he just soooo dreamy? He's such a dreamboat!\" The Song"
      - I can only imagine this being good to teenage girls in 1962
      - It's so bubblegum I feel like I'm turning pink
  - position: 8
    title: Good Luck Charm
    artist: Elvis Presley
    notes:
      - Has a nice country swing to it
      - The start-stop dynamic with the "come on and..." lyric is great
      - It's amazing how Elvis seems to rise above the rest in this era
  - position: 9
    title: Soldier Boy
    artist: The Shirelles
    notes:
      - First song about the troops! I guess...
      - A little too boring and slow
  - position: 10
    title: Stranger on the Shore
    artist: Mr. Acker Bilk
    notes:
      - "First straight-Jazz piece to hit #1; Clarinet piece"
      - The clarinet and strings play off each other well
      - Some people find the clarinet to be grading on the ears, but I think it sounds nice
  - position: 11
    title: I Can't Stop Loving You
    artist: Ray Charles
    notes:
      - Ray sounds good, but the backing chorus feels out of place for a slow R&B song
      - Ray's piano really shines, even as it sits in the back of the mixed
  - position: 12
    title: The Stripper
    artist: David Rose
    notes:
      - Jazz instrumental
      - I imagine this was the kind of music played in strip clubs back in the early '60s
      - Can't say I'm a big fan of the "strut your stuff" type of jazz here, but it's well composed
  - position: 13
    title: '"Roses Are Red (My Love)'
    artist: Bobby Vinton
    notes:
      - Pure high school love story fluff
      - I do like how simple and minimal the song is, it knows what it is so it's doesn't go overboard
  - position: 14
    title: Breaking Up Is Hard to Do
    artist: Neil Sedaka
    notes:
      - Another over-bearing doo-wop song, it really plays up the sound to the point of it being comical
      - Seems obnoxiously insincere; made to sell records
  - position: 15
    title: The Loco-Motion
    artist: Little Eva
    notes:
      - The "c'mon baby, do the locomotion!" refrain is catchy
      - Overall, it feels fresh in a genre that has sounded pretty similar across the board
  - position: 16
    title: Sheila
    artist: Tommy Roe
    notes:
      - Tommy's voice sounds so goofy; it's a shame because he sings well enough
      - The drums seem to be doing some sort of "George of the Jungle" roll the whole song; very distracting
  - position: 17
    title: Sherry
    artist: The Four Seasons
    notes:
      - "First Four Seasons song to hit #1... really? this was your best America?"
      - It's like they are doing a parody of a doo-wop group
      - It's a good song in of itself, but the performaces are so gussied up
  - position: 18
    title: Monster Mash
    artist: Bobby 'Boris' Pickett & the Crypt-Kickers
    notes:
      - The Misfits do a pretty good cover of this song
      - THIS is how you do a novelty song; don't take yourself seriously!
      - Despite being clearly a doo-wop song, it's distinctly Halloween sounding in of itself
  - position: 19
    title: He's a Rebel
    artist: The Crystals
    notes:
      - Standard Female R&B song
      - The chorus is actually quite unique and fun
      - Face-melting Sax solo
  - position: 20
    title: Big Girls Don't Cry
    artist: The Four Seasons
    notes:
      - "\"Big girls don't Crrrryrryryryryyy!!!!\" is insanely obnoxious"
      - Im probably being too cruel to The Four Seasons and their talent, but it's hard to take them seriously
  - position: 21
    title: Telstar
    artist: The Tornados
    notes:
      - Is this the first prog-rock instrumental?
      - The rhythm is really skittish; disorienting, but not in a fun way
      - It's sounds like a western set in space
