commentary: "After listening to over 1,130 songs, We've finally reached the end! Huzzah! Did we end on a good note? I'd say \"yeah\". I really have no clue which direction pop music is heading, but I really can't complain as the stuff that's here really isn't half-bad. I really like seeing songs hit #1 from artists who only just a week or two before that, were just messing around with some free beats off of YouTube, and then uploading their finished product up on Soundcloud or where ever else. THAT is inspiring if you ask me. Anyway, since we are at the end now, I will be soon working on some extended posts that will rank all of my favorite #1 hits across all of the decades as well as some other one-off posts related to the project. I hope to see you there!"
year: 2020
numberOnes:
  - title: All I Want for Christmas Is You
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Whoa, this is NOT a contemporary song... this one was released back in 1994! I guess it's a testament to how much this song has eclipsed any and all other Christmas songs in popularity
      - ...and rightfully so; this is probably the "perfect" Christmas song. It's got the best chord-progression, the best instrumentation, the best vocal performance, and the best song topic of any Christmas pop song I've ever heard
  - title: Circles
    artist: Post Malone
    notes:
      - Great reverberated acoustic-guitar; and that bassline is great!
      - The whole song has this hazy dream feel to it; I like it
      - Malone's vocal performance is great here; I love the reverb and tremolo he puts on the chorus
      - Honestly, I think Post Malone should just stick to doing harmonic singing; it suits him very well
  - title: The Box
    artist: Roddy Ricch
    notes:
      - Trap rap song; another self-produced artist
      - The wind-shield wiper "eee err" vocal hook is pretty silly, but it doesn't feel too out of place honestly
      - Ricch has got some solid flows and the lyrics are also pretty solid too
      - The faint piano chords that lie under the beat are just the icing on the cake
  - title: Blinding Lights
    artist: The Weeknd
    notes:
      - Synthwave song
      - Wow, great production on this one; reminds me of a Hall & Oates song
      - Very catchy synths lines; great meleody!
      - Outstanding vocal performance by The Weeknd; especially on that chorus
  - title: Toosie Slide
    artist: Drake
    notes:
      - Trap rap song that's also a dance song; also about social media influencer and Atlanta choreographer Toosie
      - Honestly, this one's just boring to listen to; nothing really exciting about this one
  - title: The Scotts
    artist: The Scotts
    notes:
      - Rap duo consisting of Travis Scott & Kid Cudi
      - I kinda like the beat; it's got this "ballroom music playing on an old record player" feel to it
      - Travis Scott's verses really aren't all that great and Kid Cudi sounds really goofy on this one
      - The synth breakdown towards the end sounds like the music from an old MS-DOS RPG game; I like it
  - title: Say So
    artist: Doja Cat feat. Nicki Minaj
    notes:
      - Disco-inspired pop song
      - The main riff sounds suspiciously like "Good Times" by Chic
      - Doja Cat's voice sounds pretty good; the airy vocals suit the song very well
      - Minaj's verse is a little ot of place here; kinda kills the vibe of the song
  - title: Stuck with U
    artist: Ariana Grande & Justin Bieber
    notes:
      - "Slow waltz; NOT a cover of the #1 hit by Huey Lewis & The News. Written as a sort of coronavirus pandemic love anthem"
      - Both Grande and Bieber have great voices on this one; great vocal chemistry
      - Just a solid love duet; I'm surprised they could throw this together so quickly
  - title: Savage
    artist: Megan Thee Stallion feat. Beyoncé
    notes:
      - I really like that melodic beat; I love some dissonance in my melody!
      - Great lyrics; really live up to the title of the song. She's savage
      - Beyoncé's rapping isn't actually half-bad; she's also got a pretty good lower vocal register
  - title: Rain On Me
    artist: Lady Gaga & Ariana Grande
    notes:
      - Electro-pop song
      - This sounds so much like a Daft Punk song; I like it!
      - Gaga and Grande have such good voices on this one
      - I like the "Rain... On... Me!" lyric that Gaga does; it's like a vocal drop into the dance beat
  - title: Rockstar
    artist: DaBaby feat. Roddy Ricch
    notes:
      - NOT at all related to the Post Malone song
      - I like the classical guitar that drives the beat
      - Both DaBaby and Ricch have some impressive rapping skills; great flows and vocal cadence
      - It's a good song, but I kinda wish there was more to this song; feels incomplete
  - title: Trollz
    artist: 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj
    notes:
      - 6ix9ine reminds me so much of Lil' Wayne on that chours; it's like a younger more annoying version of him
      - 6ix9ine's "hardcore" rap style feels really forced; another case of sounding tough... although considering 6ix9ine's former gang activity, he may actually be "tough", but he sure doesn't sounds like it
      - Minaj also manages to sound as obnoxious as 6ix9ine on this one
  - title: Cardigan
    artist: Taylor Swift
    notes:
      - Wow, okay... I guess Swift is now a indie-folk artist now
      - It's a very pleasant song to listen to, both lyrically and melodically. Sometimes I forget that Swift is an actual artist and not just some pop star
      - It's a good song, but it's still a far cry from the likes of Fleet Foxes or Bon Iver
  - title: Watermelon Sugar
    artist: Harry Styles
    notes:
      - "Another former One Direction member turned #1 hit solo artist; this one's a bit of a funk rock song"
      - The main hook is a bit repetitive; kinda wish Styles had more to say than just "watermelon sugar"
      - It's catchy and fun, but it's really lacking that "punch" that a song like this ought to have
  - title: WAP
    artist: Cardi B feat. Megan Thee Stallion
    notes:
      - "We've finally made it to probably the single most sexually viseral song to ever reach #1; It's literally about wet ass pussies (WAP)! We've come a long way since the Rolling Stones singing about \"spending the night together\", that's for sure"
      - That accending chromatic bass riff is just great; very metal!
      - These lyrics are some of the most shameless I've ever heard; The way they describe every kink in such detail is like a big middle-finger to the pearl-clutchers and social conservatives of the world
      - Oh yeah, their flows are also on-point here; can't forget that they can be compotent rappers sometimes
  - title: Dynamite
    artist: BTS
    notes:
      - K-pop boy band doing a disco-pop song in english to appeal to a broader audience? Hey, I'm not one to complain
      - Damn, these guys are pretty funky and their english is actually pretty good here; they got a pretty commanding presence on this track
      - Godd performance from all involved; a well-produced funky pop song
  - title: Franchise
    artist: Travis Scott feat. Young Thug and M.I.A.
    notes:
      - I really like those ominous synths that drive the song; makes the song feel so much more badass
      - Great flows by Scott and Young Thug; they really go hard here
      - "It's cool to see M.I.A. on a #1 hit song years after her relevance, but she sounds so flat and bored on this one"
  - title: Savage Love (Laxed-Siren Beat)
    artist: Jawsh 685, Jason Derulo & BTS
    notes:
      - Reggaeton song; practically a cover of the song by BTS; Derulo is basically nowhere to be found
      - Honestly, this song is really tacky; the production sounds like it was made on a cheap plastic keyboard and BTS's performance is a little silly-sounding here
  - title: Mood
    artist: 24kGoldn feat. Iann Dior
    notes:
      - Electric-guitar driven rap song
      - Very catchy beat and great flows by 24kGoldn and Dior
  - title: Positions
    artist: Ariana Grande
    notes:
      - I like the pizzicato strings that drive the beat, but I can't say I like the cricket-chirping in the background; very distracting
      - I like how many layers of vocals are on the track; they all harmonize with each other very well and add a timbre to the song that many others don't have
      - Very catchy chorus; I like it
  - title: Life Goes On
    artist: BTS
    notes:
      - "The first #1 hit song to be in Korean; I guess BTS managed to become big enough in the states that the language barrier wasn't enough to keep these guys froming hitting #1"
      - I like the laid-back beat with that guitar; very dreamy sounding and somber
      - Solid vocal work here; the group's got a nice vocal breadth
      - I do think the Korean rapping sections sound a bit forced and silly
  - title: Willow
    artist: Taylor Swift
    notes:
      - Another indie-folk song by Swift
      - I really like that acoustic-guitar riff; very rich in sound
      - Great chorus; very catchy and singable
      - Another pleasant indie-folk venture; I think this one's even better than the last one she did
