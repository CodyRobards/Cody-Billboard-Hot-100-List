numberOnes:
  - title: My Sweet Lord / Isn't It a Pity
    artist: George Harrison
    notes:
      - "It barely took a few months before one of The Beatles scored a #1 hit after their breakup"
      - A very religious song that like SUPER inclusive, as the lyrics mention a plethora of deities
      - Those slide guitar solos are addicting to listen to
      - The backing vocals are really what make this song great... "Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"
      - The B-side "Isn't It a Pity", as good as the lyrics are, kind of drags on for 7 minutes; it can be shorter for sure
  - title: Knock Three Times
    artist: Tony Orlando & Dawn
    notes:
      - The premise of this song is just weird; it's like they are P-O-Ws and have to communicate this way so the prison guards won't know they are trying to hook up
      - I mean, he can just knock on her door and just talk to her...
      - Silly song, but not a bad song
  - title: One Bad Apple
    artist: The Osmonds
    notes:
      - Forget what I said about The Partridge Family; THIS is the white Jackson 5. The resemblance is uncanny
      - One Apple DOES spoil the whole bunch. What drugs were they on?
      - Scratch that, maybe they weren't on ENOUGH drugs.
  - title: Me and Bobby McGee
    artist: Janis Joplin
    notes:
      - "Another posthumous #1 song; several months after Joplin's death"
      - Song written by Kris Kristofferson; about the relationship of two homeless drifters
      - This song is just great; good story-telling, good vocals, good instrumentation
      - It's tragic we lost such a unique voice in music
  - title: Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)
    artist: The Temptations
    notes:
      - A very relaxing song to listen to; personifies daydreaming too well
      - Those vocals are just too good
      - On top of that, the string section does a very good job of serving the song
  - title: Joy to the World
    artist: Three Dog Night
    notes:
      - Accomplishes what "Everything Is Beautiful" couldn't.
      - Turns out making an upbeat and catchy song brings people together better then any World Peace anthem could
      - Song is kinda of silly, but I think that's what they were going for
  - title: Brown Sugar
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    notes:
      - A nice blue rock song; almost like a throwback to the Rock N' Roll days
      - Let's take a moment to recognize Keith Richard on guitar; he can write a damn good riff!
      - There's even a sax solo! I feel like it's been a while since I've heard one of those
  - title: Want Ads
    artist: Honey Cone
    notes:
      - A love song about looking through the classifieds to find a man
      - You know, like in a newspaper?
      - Anybody my age or younger remember those?
      - A decent funk song; catchy and upbeat
  - title: It's Too Late / I Feel the Earth Move
    artist: Carole King
    notes:
      - A soft rock song that manages to be really funky
      - A really good chorus; very catchy
      - I love the guitar/tenor-sax/organ jam in the middle; so good!
      - Damn, I really love this B-Side "I Feel the Earth Move". I'm impressed how well King blends soft rock with funk!
  - title: Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)
    artist: Paul Revere & The Raiders
    notes:
      - A bluey rock song about The Cherokee Nation
      - The early '70s saw a large civil rights movement focused on justice for Native Americans
      - A lot better than the previous Native-American themed songs we've heard. Like, WAAAAY better
      - Is this Jethro Tull? It sounds like Jethro Tull... and that's a good thing!
  - title: You've Got A Friend
    artist: James Taylor
    notes:
      - Acoustic soft rock song about friendship
      - Those arpeggiated chords are fantastic; I wish this song was easier to play on guitar. It's hard as nails!
      - That bridge section is one of the best I've ever heard; the perfect chords!
  - title: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - "First Bee Gees #1 hit; before they went disco"
      - A slow swingy breakup song
      - It's an okay song, not too bad
  - title: Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey
    artist: Paul & Linda McCartney
    notes:
      - Not a double single, just one song with two halves
      - The first half is so hard to describe. It's like a pop-song while at the same time being completely genre-less
      - The second half feels like something off of Magical Mystery Tour; it's like some kind of art rock experiment
      - Changes gears all over the place, you could skip around this song and each section would sound like it's own song
      - I like it but maybe Paul is getting a little too carried away here
  - title: Go Away Little Girl
    artist: Donny Osmond
    notes:
      - "Oh boy, it's a cover of one the previous #1 hit songs, and I didn't like that one to much"
      - Okay, now it's even weirder now that a little kid is singing it
      - I will say it's better than the original; but not by much
  - title: Maggie May / Reason to Believe
    artist: Rod Stewart
    notes:
      - Classic folk rock song
      - Any song with a well-played 12-string guitar will always be good in my book
      - I love the simple clean guitar solo after the second verse; serves the song well
      - The mandolin that comes in towards the end is great; really finalizes the song
      - The B-side "Reason to Believe" is okay, the organ is a little too overbearing
  - title: Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves
    artist: Cher
    notes:
      - Minor-key folk song, haven't seen one of these in a while
      - For such a simple folk song, there's soooo many instruments playing at once
      - It's a good song, just kind of wish it was a little simpler
  - title: Theme from Shaft
    artist: Isaac Hayes
    notes:
      - Theme from the classic blaxploitation film
      - Talk about a funk overload! so many wah pedals and horn sections!
      - I couldn't think of a better song for a film like Shaft; too good!
  - title: Family Affair
    artist: Sly & The Family Stone
    notes:
      - "\"Let's follow up one funk overload with another!\" said America in 1971"
      - This one's more of a spoken word song; with the lyrics being said over a funk groove
      - It's a good song, but I like their previous songs better
  - title: Brand New Key
    artist: Melanie
    notes:
      - A very cheery folk song
      - This chick roller-skates everywhere doesn't she?
      - The vocals on this one are insane; it sounds like she's going to burst into tears any second
