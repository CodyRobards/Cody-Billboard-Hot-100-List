commentary_excerpt: "An iconic year where Minneapolis funk met British synthpop on the Hot 100."
commentary: |
  1984 balanced stadium-sized hooks with daring studio experimentation. Prince's "When Doves Cry" ruled the charts
  without a bass line, while British bands like Duran Duran delivered cinematic pop moments. These sonic risks
  reverberated through the decade and set the stage for the [Top 220 Neon Nights ranking](/rankings/top-220-neon-nights-1984-08-04/).
