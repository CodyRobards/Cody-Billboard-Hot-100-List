numberOnes:
  - title: Firework
    artist: Katy Perry
    notes:
      - I guess this is my generation's self-empowerment anthem...
      - I really like how the song builds up to that chorus; very powerful vocal performace by Perry
      - Solid bridge section too!
      - Honestly, It's pretty good; I would've thought a song like this would've had a bunch of bottle-poppin references since that's the only music I remember from 11 years ago, but this one's pretty clean and timeless
  - title: Grenade
    artist: Bruno Mars
    notes:
      - Slow pop ballad
      - A bit of a weird premise for a love song; Mars, my man. You're upset she WOULDN'T jump on a grenade for you? What kind of lunatic are you?!
      - Solid vocal performance by Mars, but the song is dawdling as hell
  - title: Hold It Against Me
    artist: Britney Spears
    notes:
      - Dance-pop song
      - Oh my god, it's got a dub-step breakdown... Nothing dates a song to the early '10s like one of those! (I still like it though...)
      - I guess it's catchy enough, but it's really nothing too special
  - title: Black and Yellow
    artist: Wiz Khalifa
    notes:
      - Hip hop song; it's got this extremely repetitive hook, but I guess it's catchy
      - I remember when people thought this song was about the Pittsburg Steelers despite the VERY OBVIOUS sports car references throughout the whole song
      - Solid flow by Khalifa; not half-bad
  - title: Born This Way
    artist: Lady Gaga
    notes:
      - Gay anthem about being proud of who you are; very reminiscent of the '90s dance club music that was associate with the gay community
      - Okay... this is probably one of the WORST mixed songs I've heard so far. It's SO DAMN LOUD; I can barely hear the vocals amongst the cacophony
  - title: E.T.
    artist: Katy Perry feat. Kanye West
    notes:
      - West's opening verse is pretty solid
      - The vocal cadence of Perry is pretty good; fits the song well
      - Another over-produced chorus; they really couldn't help but crank every instrument up to 11
      - West's second verse is a little bit weak; also the lyrics are absolutely hilarious
  - title: S&M
    artist: Rihanna feat. Britney Spears
    notes:
      - Eurodance remix featuring Britney Spears; take a guess at what this song is about
      - Solid chorus; very catchy and that synth riff helps alot
      - Kind of weird listening to this song after her, let's just say, "rocky" relationship with Chris Brown
  - title: Rolling in the Deep
    artist: Adele
    notes:
      - Soul song; When I first heard this song, I thought it was an Amy Winehouse song
      - Great vocal performance by Adele; especially during that chorus
      - It's cool to hear a song like this one, heavily inspired by '60s soul, top the chart during a year of over-produced robotic music
  - title: Give Me Everything
    artist: Pitbull feat. Ne-Yo, Afrojack & Nayer
    notes:
      - Club trash; pretty much the only place I can imagine it being played
      - It's not half-bad, for what it's worth; Ne-Yo sounds pretty good on that chorus
      - Pitbull's rap verses are also pretty decent
  - title: Party Rock Anthem
    artist: LMFAO feat. Lauren Bennett & GoonRock
    notes:
      - Electro-dance song; Not a rock song, by the way
      - What the hell was that lyric? "No lead in our zeppelin!" I guess that's the "rock" part of the song
      - I always thought the "everyday I'm shufflin'" line was funny
      - It's like they were trying to make the most infectious dance song ever, and I guess they succeeded
  - title: Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)
    artist: Katy Perry
    notes:
      - '"Drunken white girl" The Song'
      - I guess it's catchy and well-performed, but the lyrics are just so cringy. "T.G.I.F."? I don't know if God approves of your lifestyle, Katy
      - Wait, what?! A sax solo? Well that was unexpected
      - Okay, supposedly this was written as a response to Kesha's songs about the same topic, so I guess it's tongue-in-cheek?
  - title: Moves Like Jagger
    artist: Maroon 5 feat. Christina Aguilera
    notes:
      - Pop rock song about the Rolling Stones frontman, or I guess it's about his "moves"
      - The whistle-hook is kinda neat; and the funk guitar is nice to listen to
      - Catchy chorus; Adam Levine's peroformance on this song is pretty solid
      - Aguilera's verse isn't anything too special; they really could've had anyone featured and It wouldn't have made a difference
  - title: Someone Like You
    artist: Adele
    notes:
      - Piano ballad; literally just a piano and Adele's voice.
      - That piano progression is so good; It's nice to hear just a dry piano on a song sometimes
      - Great vocal performance by Adele; I guess that's par for the course for her
      - Great bridge section; I love the stacked vocals that come in
  - title: We Found Love
    artist: Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris
    notes:
      - Electro-dance song
      - Good electric piano hook; very catchy
      - Rihanna's vocal performance is really on-point here
      - Can't have an early 2010s club song without a bass drop
      - I think this is a great song, but it suffers from over-production like many songs of it's era
