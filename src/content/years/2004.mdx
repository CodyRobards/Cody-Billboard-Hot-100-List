commentary: Pretty garbage year; completely dominated by Usher, and his "smooth" style of R&B just doesn't do it for me, Jack. Also, there were some other songs that I think were just straight duds. It was so bad that my favorite song from 2003, "Hey Ya!" was also my favorite song from this year; Not a good sign. Oh man, and we haven't even really gotten to the "Crunk" era yet, so I can only imagine how much worse it can get.
year: 2004
numberOnes:
  - title: Hey Ya!
    artist: Outkast
    notes:
      - Acoustic guitar driven hip hop song; sung entirelly by André 3000
      - I really like the chord progression; it's all major chords which is a little different, concidering how you usually have at least 1 minor chord when you do the "4-chords"
      - Very solid verses from André 3000; he really brings it
      - For such an upbeat song, it's got some pretty sad lyrics
      - The mid-section is so much fun to listen to "What's cooler than being cool? ICE COLD! Alrightalrightalright..."
      - The breakdown is also really damn good too; "Shake it like a Polaroid picture!"
  - title: The Way You Move
    artist: Outkast feat. Sleepy Brown
    notes:
      - "Another Outkast #1 hit; this time sung by Big Boi"
      - Great use of the 808 drum machine here; very catchy rhythm
      - Real nice smooth chorus; solid vocal harmonies
      - Besides the cheesy lyrics and repetitiveness, it's a fairly solid song
  - title: Slow Jamz
    artist: Twista feat. Kanye West & Jamie Foxx
    notes:
      - A smooth R&B/Hip-hop song that sends a salute to the "slow jams" of years of old; samples "A House Is Not A Home" performed by Luther Vandross
      - Twista's verses are so lame and cheesy; West's and Foxx's are fairly decent and have good flow
      - I really wouldn't say this is a good song; very rushed and not well-thought out
  - title: Yeah!
    artist: Usher feat. Lil' Jon & Ludacris
    notes:
      - "Oh god... this is it. Our first \"Crunk\" #1 hit song, my least favorite sub-genre of all-time. However, let's put that aside and judge the song on it's own qualities"
      - Well, I'm actually impressed by Usher on this one; his voice suits the song well
      - Can't say I like Lil' Jon on this one; his ad-libs are distracting and forced as hell
      - I guess the acid synth lines are kinda good; catchy enough
      - Ludacris' parts are fairly solid; but the "booty" outro is cheesy as hell
  - title: Burn
    artist: Usher
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo R&B ballad
      - Usher's vocal performace is fairly solid; besides that, this song is largely forgettable
  - title: I Believe
    artist: Fantasia
    notes:
      - Gospel piano ballad; sung by another "American Idol" contestant
      - Wow, this is really out of place in 2004; it sounds like it belongs in 1994 instead!
      - Although it's neat and refreshing to hear a song that isn't '00s R&B, this song isn't really anything too special
  - title: Confessions Pt. II
    artist: Usher
    notes:
      - Smooth R&B song
      - I do think this is Usher's best performance so far, It still pretty indistinguishable from his other songs
  - title: Slow Motion
    artist: Juvenile feat. Soulja Slim
    notes:
      - "Another posthumous hit; went to #1 about a year after Slim's murder"
      - Bah, a real lame attempt at trying to sound cool and tough in a rap song
      - ...Man, I hate to speak ill of the dead, but Slim's verses are really cheesy and "juvenile" Ha!
      - Very repetitive as well
  - title: Lean Back
    artist: Terror Squad
    notes:
      - "Oh shit, I remember this song from the game soundtrack for Need For Speed: Underground 2!"
      - Solid beat; feels very weighty
      - Very catchy chorus
      - Solid flows from all involved, but It just feels like the song as a whole is missing that "oompf"
  - title: Goodies
    artist: Ciara feat. Petey Pablo
    notes:
      - Oh god, that whistling drill synth in the back is soooo damn distracting; it's like a dogwhistle being blown throughout the song
      - Besides Pablo's decent verses, Ciara really doesn't have the voice to be a singer; you can tell she's struggling to hit... ANY notes on this song
      - It is kinda catchy; but that can't make up for the thrown-together, phoned-in, low-effort production job on this one. They really should have re-done everyone's takes and make a better beat
  - title: My Boo
    artist: Usher feat. Alica Keys
    notes:
      - Another mid-tempo R&B song by Usher
      - It's got a neat sample; I can't figure out where it's from, but it sounds like the mice from the film "Babe" xD
      - I would just write this one off as another dawdling song from Usher, but Key's performance is pretty good on this one, and it really elevates the song as a whole
  - title: Drop It Like It's Hot
    artist: Snoop Dogg feat. Pharrell Williams
    notes:
      - "Fairly minimal hip-hop song; It really took a whole decade for Snoop Dogg to get a #1, didn't it?"
      - I will say, that "tongue knocking" sound is a little silly; but I guess it's "tongue-in-cheek"! Hahaha!
      - The chorus is pretty catchy, and the snappy synths are a nice touch
      - Snoop Dogg really owns this track; his verses are on-point, but I can't say the same for Williams. He really just sounds way to straight-edge on this one
      - Besides all of that, I still think the song as a whole is much better than the sum of it's parts
