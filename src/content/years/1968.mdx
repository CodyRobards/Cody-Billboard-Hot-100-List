year: 1968
numberOnes:
  - title: Hello, Goodbye
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - Even my least favorite Beatles hit is still a banger
      - The lyrics are mindlessly repetitive, but even then it's still catchy
      - The drums sound so good!
      - The stereo mix of this song is so well done; feels like it could have be laid down yesterday
  - title: Judy In Disguise (With Glasses)
    artist: John Fred and His Playboy Band
    notes:
      - Amazing drum beat and bass line; very funky
      - Feels like a throwback to '50s rock in a way, I guess even back then there was a market for nostalgia
  - title: Green Tambourine
    artist: The Lemon Pipers
    notes:
      - I guess by 1968, every rock band felt like they needed to have sitar in their songs
      - Nothing too special; probably the most middling rock song I've heard from this era so far
  - title: Love is Blue
    artist: Paul Mauriat
    notes:
      - French pop song re-recorded as an orchestral piece
      - A nice blend of easy-listening orchestra and '60s psychedelic music
      - "It's a nice song, but lacks the emotion of some of the past instrumentals to reach #1"
  - title: (Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay
    artist: Otis Redding
    notes:
      - "First posthumous #1 hit, 3 months after Redding died in a plane crash"
      - Very laid-back and very introspective
      - Amazing instrumentation, so subtle and appropriate
      - Vocally impressive and catchy; hard to not sing to
      - There's even a nice little whistling solo at the end!
  - title: Honey
    artist: Bobby Goldsboro
    notes:
      - Sad song mourning the loss of a wife
      - It's well-performed, but lacks the gut-punch a song like this should have
  - title: Tighten Up Pt. 1
    artist: Archie Bell & the Drells
    notes:
      - quasi-instrumental R&B song; it's like the '60s equivalent of the Cha Cha Slide
      - First self-name drop I've heard so far
      - Amazing guitar chord progression
      - Very funky and upbeat
      - The horns come in at just the right time
  - title: Mrs. Robinson
    artist: Simon & Garfunkel
    notes:
      - An excellent blend of folk and pop; perfect for the era
      - Surprisingly religious for a pop song
      - The vocals from the two are well harmonized; real powerful delivery
      - Those little guitar breaks through the song are just great
  - title: This Guy's in Love with You
    artist: Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass
    notes:
      - A slow swingy traditional pop song
      - Great instrumentation; very whispy and ethereal
      - I really like the build-up to the powerful chorus; makes it really stand out
      - Very nice trumpet solo in the middle; subtle and appropriate
  - title: Grazing in the Grass
    artist: Hugh Masekela
    notes:
      - A nice little jazzy insturmental
      - very upbeat and catchy; but the banging on the cowbell is a little distracting
  - title: Hello, I Love You
    artist: The Doors
    notes:
      - The "Call Me, Maybe" of the '60s
      - That grimmy, acid distortion on the guitar is straight-up badass
      - The groove on this song is amazing
      - The build-up to the outro is also outstanding
  - title: People Got to Be Free
    artist: The Rascals
    notes:
      - I guess The Young Rascals grew up this year, they're The Rascals now!
      - The groove of "Groovin'" from last year is back and even more upbeat this time
      - Just a great performance from everyone
  - title: Harper Valley PTA
    artist: Jeannie C. Riley
    notes:
      - A nice, little funky pop-country song
      - Mom sticking up for her daughter against a hypocritical school PTA
      - A silly song, but probably one of the most relatable songs fron the era; this '60s counter-culture movement is turning our kids into dang hippies!
  - title: Hey Jude
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - "#1 for 9 weeks, beating \"Tossin' and Turnin'\" for longest-running #1 up until this point, and deservingly so; this is an amazing song!"
      - Probably one of the best piano ballads ever written
      - If I had to pick one song to bringing people together, this would be it
      - That outro is too damn good; I don't care if it drags the song out for another 4 minutes!
  - title: Love Child
    artist: Diana Ross & the Supremes
    notes:
      - The Supremes attempt to blend their sound with the late '60s sound
      - The best Supremes song so far, this was what they needed to do
      - Amazing performace by Diana Ross here, and even the rest of the group does pretty good too!
      - Great chorus; very powerful
  - title: I Heard It Through the Grapevine
    artist: Marvin Gaye
    notes:
      - I absolutely love that main riff; so damn gritty
      - Outstanding vocals from Gaye, so glad he's now topping the charts!
