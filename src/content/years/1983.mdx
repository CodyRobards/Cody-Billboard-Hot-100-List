commentary: An even better year! This one had so many great songs, it'll be hard to rank them in my final list across the decades. This is the first year where I can say that there wasn't a single "meh" or bad song. Impressive!
year: 1983
numberOnes:
  - title: Maneater
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    notes:
      - A very minimal synth-pop song
      - That bass line is so bad-ass sounding
      - I really like the swingy rhythm; suits the song very well
      - Great vocal performance; that chorus is very catchy
      - Amazing sax solo in the middle, just fantastic
  - title: Down Under
    artist: Men At Work
    notes:
      - Another Australian new wave song; this times it's actually about Australia!
      - Great flute throughout the whole song
      - Very catchy chorus
      - The whole of the lyrics are silly but very endearing; I would say a good ambassador for Australia
  - title: Africa
    artist: Toto
    notes:
      - 'Wow, two #1 hits songs about geography in a row! amazing!'
      - Amazing use of percussion throughout; fits the theme of the song very well
      - Also, amazing synths as well!
      - Very powerful chorus, and those vocal harmonies... just outstanding
      - I know this song has become a meme of sorts, but it really is just a great song; Toto's magnum opus
  - title: Baby, Come to Me
    artist: Patti Austin & James Ingram
    notes:
      - A smooth R&B song
      - Very solid instrumentation; a perfect blend of timbres
      - Ingram is the better singer of the two; kinda makes me think it would have been better solo with him
  - title: Billie Jean
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - From the album "Thriller" the highest selling album of all-time
      - THIS was the one song that probably changed the pop music landscape the most this decade. The song, the album it was on, the music video, so much from just this one song
      - That drum beat with that bassline... just perfect
      - ...and then those synth stabs come in! It's so good!
      - Fantastic vocal performance from Jackson
      - That little guitar break that shows up around the mid-point is sooooo funky
  - title: Come On Eileen
    artist: Dexys Midnight Runners
    notes:
      - Unique sort of celtic/folk pop-song; strong use of strings and banjos
      - Very catchy verse and chorus; good vocal performance
      - Wow, a downward key change for the chorus! We haven't seen that since "Penny Lane"
      - I love how the song breaks down in the middle, and then speeds back up to the last chorus
  - title: Beat It
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - Pop song with a hard rock edge; Eddie Van Halen on guitar!
      - Another great intro with those synths and drum machine
      - Oh yeah, that guitar riff is just bad-ass
      - I love the little breakdown after the second chorus; very metal!
      - One of the best guitar solos in a pop-song I've heard so far; up there with "My Sharona"
  - title: Let's Dance
    artist: David Bowie
    notes:
      - 'Two #1 hits in a row that feature a guitar virtuoso! This time with Stevie Ray Vaughan'
      - Bowie's vocals are outstanding on this one; such passion and power!
      - The build-up during the chorus is great; not many songs I've heard so far do that
      - SRV's inclusion is great; it's not over done anywhere; his little bits sprinkled throughout are the icing on the cake!
  - title: Flashdance... What a Feeling
    artist: Irene Cara
    notes:
      - Synth-pop song written for the film of the same name
      - I like the chord progression in this song; very well done especially during the chorus
      - I like the song, but it unfortunately, it's nothing too special when compared to everything else we've heard this year so far
  - title: Every Breath You Take
    artist: The Police
    notes:
      - A Soft rock/new wave song about a stalker
      - So many people think this is a love song... it's not. It's about a LITERAL stalker
      - That guitar riff is so good; fits the theme of the song so well
      - That bridge is just legendary; "I keep cryin' baby... baby... pleeeeeeaaaaase!"
      - There are so many subtle bits of this song that just complement the song so well throughout
      - The backing vocals during the outro is fantastic. THAT is how you fade out a song!
  - title: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)
    artist: Eurythmics
    notes:
      - The most synth-poppy song you've ever heard; it sounds like we are in the lab of a mad scientist
      - Annie Lennox's vocals are just outstanding on this song
      - That bridge followed by that synth solo is just great; it's sooooo good!
  - title: Maniac
    artist: Michael Sembello
    notes:
      - Synth-pop song also from the film "Flashdance"
      - Very fast and upbeat
      - The percussion makes it feel like we are in an industrial zone
      - I really like the bridge; very disorienting but in a good way... plus that guitar solo!
      - A solid song; very well done but suffers from being surrounded by better songs from this year
  - title: Tell Her About It
    artist: Billy Joel
    notes:
      - A rockabilly song... kind of nice to hear this in a year full of synth-pop
      - The lyrics are good, but a little too on-the-nose
      - Not a half-bad song; catchy and upbeat
  - title: Total Eclipse of the Heart
    artist: Bonnie Tyler
    notes:
      - A slow ballad
      - Great use of vocals throughout; I especially like the call-response of the "turn around..." line
      - I really like how the song builds up to the chorus, but then chorus then continues to build up to that last line; great movement!
      - I do think the instrumentation in the middle is kind of lacking
      - You know, for a slow ballad, it ACTUALLY manages to wake you up instead of put you to sleep; somehow they did it here
  - title: Islands In the Stream
    artist: Kenny Rodgers & Dolly Parton
    notes:
      - The two biggest pop-country stars of 1983 unite!
      - These two have great vocal chemistry; sounds great
      - Good chorus; nice and rhythmic sounding
  - title: All Night Long (All Night)
    artist: Lionel Richie
    notes:
      - A sort of reggae/synth pop song
      - Interesting use of drum machines; it's like we are in the middle a jungle at night
      - I can hear Lionel trying his best to not go all-out with the patois impression; it's kinda funny
      - It's a very nice and upbeat song; not half-bad and pleasant to listen to
  - title: Say Say Say
    artist: Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - An upbeat post-disco duet by two of the biggest pop stars in the world at the time
      - Funny enough, they really don't sing all that much together. They kind of just take turns with the verses
      - A real killer harmonica solo in the middle; a welcome surprise!
      - Just a solid pop song; not too much to complain about
