commentary: Starting off the '80s with a bang! some great songs this year! It really did take for the calandar to roll into 1980 for the sound landscape to change. I'm happy we are finally here!
year: 1980
numberOnes:
  - title: Please Don't Go
    artist: KC & The Sunshine Band
    notes:
      - Slow soft rock ballad
      - The main synth line is pleasant
      - I like how the songs picks up towards the end
      - Honestly, not a bad attempt for a slow song by a disco-only band
  - title: Escape (The Piña Colada Song)
    artist: Rupert Holmes
    notes:
      - "Last song to reach #1 in the '70s, so let's end it with some yacht rock!"
      - The song's about a guy who starts an affair with a mystery woman in the classifieds
      - ...but SURPRISE! It was his wife he was trying to hookup with in the classifieds ALL ALONG!
      - I guess if you both cheat on each other with yourselves, that's okay and won't tank your marriage AT ALL, I'm sure
      - I mean, did they EVER talk about anything with each other AT ALL during their whole marriage? it took them this long to discover each other?
      - Either than that, it's a decent song; It's actually surprisingly down-to-earth. The characters aren't rockstars with larger-than-life personalities, but instead just regular people
  - title: Rock with You
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - Insanely good groove throughout the whole song; top notch
      - Michael's vocal performance is really good; not overdone and even the backing vocals are on point
      - That little synth line after the bridge is outstanding
  - title: Do That To Me One More Time
    artist: Captain & Tennille
    notes:
      - Slow yacht rock ballad
      - This is one of my biggest problems with the many attempts of yacht rock; it's like they are trying to be slow, dreamy, and ethereal, but most of the time, it just comes off as tacky public access stock music
  - title: Crazy Little Thing Called Love
    artist: Queen
    notes:
      - Rockabilly song
      - Not really in Queen's wheelhouse, but they pull it off pretty good
      - Very catchy; a testament of their ability as performers
  - title: Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2
    artist: Pink Floyd
    notes:
      - Concept album prog rock song
      - Wait? WHAT?! Okay, like the song "Frankenstein", America just decided they liked prog rock all of a sudden
      - Insanely funky and catchy
      - Very anthemic as well "We don't need no education! We don't need no thought control!"
      - Absolutely amazing guitar solo at the end!
      - "Honestly, I love this song to death, but it feels really weird to listen to without the two songs that precide it: \"Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 1\" and \"The Happiest Days of our Lives\". This song's a part of the concept album \"The Wall\". Listening to the song isolated like this just feels wrong. If you haven't listened to \"The Wall\" from front to back, or seen the film that goes with it, you really need to. It's insanely trippy and quite the experience"
  - title: Call Me
    artist: Blondie
    notes:
      - Upbeat new wave song
      - Okay, THIS is how you do a song!
      - That galloping riff is just outstanding
      - An amazing chorus; that call-response bit "Call Me! (Call Me!)" is phenomenal
      - Hell, even the french-lyric bridge is neat; plus an amazing keyboard solo!
  - title: Funkytown
    artist: Lipps Inc.
    notes:
      - Funk song; I mean, it's in the title
      - I mean, it really is a funky song; hard to not bob your head to it
      - I really wish I could say more; it's just a really good funk song. It really is something that explains itself when you listen to it
  - title: Coming Up
    artist: Paul McCartney
    notes:
      - "Live version of the song that when to #1"
      - Probably the fastest Paul has ever played; it helps too, as the speed of the song fits the funk rock feel real well
      - It's not a half-bad song, but it does kind of drag on despite only being 4 minutes long
  - title: It's Still Rock and Roll to Me
    artist: Billy Joel
    notes:
      - A nice little rockabilly song
      - Very funny lyrics, but in good way; it's very light-hearted
      - Great sax solo in the middle
      - Just a real well-done song; great performance
  - title: Magic
    artist: Olivia Newton-John
    notes:
      - Has a very interesting chord progression; the guitar has some kind of "chorus effect" on it
      - They did a realy good job of making the song "magical" sounding; props to the producers
      - "I think this song suits Newton-John's vocals much better than her previous #1 hits"
      - Not half-bad; I guess the '80s sound really worked to her advantage
  - title: Sailing
    artist: Christopher Cross
    notes:
      - Hey! A fellow musician from San Antonio, Texas!
      - An amazing string intro; fading well into the guitar and drums
      - THAT guitar riff... and that TONE... absolutely amazing
      - Very pleasant bridge; nice piano
      - THIS song was the peak of yacht rock; it did what every other attempt couldn't do, which was to embody the dreamy, ethereal feeling of... well... sailing
  - title: Upside Down
    artist: Diana Ross
    notes:
      - Wow, I guess knowing that the dude is cheating on you isn't enough for you to want to dump him since "no one makes [you] feel like [he does]"
      - It's got a nice bit of funk to it; but I think it's boring and overplayed on the radio
  - title: Another One Bites The Dust
    artist: Queen
    notes:
      - There is no bass line on earth that makes one feel as badass as this one
      - Those reverse fade-in piano chords are amazing
      - Also amazing funky guitar bits by Brian May
      - Let's also take a moment to appreciate Freddie Mercury's vocals; absolutely outstanding here
  - title: Woman in Love
    artist: Barbra Streisand
    notes:
      - Honestly, just a lame slow, soft ballad; It could have been so much more but it's so plain
      - I guess the chorus is kind of good; it's got a nice vocal harmony
  - title: Lady
    artist: Kenny Rogers
    notes:
      - Song written by Lionel Ritchie
      - Another slow and boring song; I have a feeling it would have been better had Ritchie keep it for himself
  - title: (Just Like) Starting Over
    artist: John Lennon
    notes:
      - "Another posthumous #1 hit; just two weeks after Lennon's murder"
      - It's like a rockabilly song kind of; definitely John trying to emulate the kind of music he grew up listening to
      - Not a half bad song; it's a damn shame his life was cut so short. I imagine he would have made some good tunes during the '80s
