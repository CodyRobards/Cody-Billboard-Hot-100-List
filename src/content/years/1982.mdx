numberOnes:
  - title: Physical
    artist: Olivia Newton-John
    notes:
      - '#1 for 10 consectutive weeks, tieing "You Light Up My Life" by Debby Boone for the longest running #1 hit song'
      - There's a sort of delay-effect on Newton-John's vocals, it's kind of neat
      - Great guitar solo in the middle
      - It's an alright song; not something I would write home about
  - title: I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    notes:
      - Okay, this is the BEST drum machine I've heard so heard
      - Outstanding synth lines throughout the whole song
      - There's a sort of call-response thing between Hall & Oates' vocals; I like it
      - I also like the real subtle guitar riff under synth lines
      - Oh, and there's also TWO banger sax solos too!
  - title: Centerfold
    artist: The J. Geils Band
    notes:
      - Very upbeat pop-rock song
      - This song's weird; it's has the vibe of a kid-friendly song but it's about a Playboy centerfold
      - The main line during the chorus is nice and catchy
      - Overall, a pretty solid rock song
  - title: I Love Rock N' Roll
    artist: Joan Jett & The Blackhearts
    notes:
      - Former guitarist for punk band The Runaways turned pop-rockstar
      - Cover of an old '70s rock song by The Arrows
      - Let's get this out of the way; this is THE rock anthem to end all rock anthems
      - That guitar riff is just too damn iconic
      - Plus that guitar solo; it's the icing on the cake
  - title: Chariots Of Fire
    artist: Vangelis
    notes:
      - Synthpop instrumental made for the film of the same name
      - It's what is usually plasted over a video of a guy falling off of a diving board in slo-mo
      - The bass synth really helps to make the song sound very triumphant
      - I even like the main piano line; very pleasant
  - title: Ebony and Ivory
    artist: Paul McCartney & Stevie Wonder
    notes:
      - Song written about racial unity during the time of Apartheid in South Africa
      - They both vocally sound good together, but it's nothing too special
      - The main synth line during the bridge sounds like an electric banjo; I don't like it
      - It's an alright song, a little too cheesy sounding for such a serious topic
  - title: Don't You Want Me
    artist: The Human League
    notes:
      - This song is typically considered one of the best synthpop songs of the '80s
      - I'm gonna go against popular opinion; I don't like this song
      - There is just Waaaayyy too much going on in this song; too many synths at once is an attack on the ears
      - Besides the chorus, the vocal performance is lacking all-around
  - title: Eye of the Tiger
    artist: Survivor
    notes:
      - Hard rock song written for the film Rocky 3
      - "That's TWO #1 hit songs from the Rocky series of films!"
      - Another absolute banger of a rock anthem
      - I mean, this song just reeks of ambition, motivation, and determination. Perfect for a montage!
      - Great guitar, vocals, and rhythm; just a great song
  - title: Abracadabra
    artist: Steve Miller Band
    notes:
      - Hard rock sog about a witch
      - Great guitar riff; fits the mystic feel of the song
      - Also great synths on this one; also very fitting
      - The slide and whammy guitar solo is very unique and just straight-up badass
      - Outstanding outro; very spooky and ethereal sounding
  - title: Hard to Say I'm Sorry
    artist: Chicago
    notes:
      - Soft rock ballad
      - In 1976, it was Steve Miller who knocked Chicago off of top of the charts, but Chicago strikes back!
      - Solid piano work on this one; good chord progession
      - Great vocals from Peter Cetera here, also great vocal harmonies
      - Solid ballad; unfortunately the single version excludes the second half of the movement "Get Away" which is almost a metal song and has a badass horn section
  - title: Jack & Diane
    artist: John Mellencamp
    notes:
      - "'80s heartland American teenage love anthem"
      - I really how minimal the song is, just an acoustic guitar with a drum machine and the occasion bass and piano
      - I really like the chorus line; "Oh yeah life goes on, long after the thrill of livin' is gone..."
  - title: Who Can It Be Now?
    artist: Men At Work
    notes:
      - Australian New wave song about a paranoid hermit
      - Outstanding sax all throughout the song
      - Great chorus; very singable
      - Just all-round great instrumentation; everything fits together so well here
      - Also, just an outstanding outro; those vocal harmonies are fantastic
  - title: Up Where We Belong
    artist: Joe Cocker & Jennifer Warnes
    notes:
      - Soft piano ballad duet written for the romance film "An Officer and a Gentleman"
      - Has a nice chorus; sounds good
      - Besides that, this song is largely forgettable; total snoozer
  - title: Truly
    artist: Lionel Richie
    notes:
      - Piano ballad; this guy just could not go a second without writing one of these, could he?
      - At this point, all of his songs just sound the same; I thought "Endless Love" was good, but I think that one has something going for it. This one's just "meh
      - I mean it's not a bad song, but at this point he just sounds like a one-trick pony
  - title: Mickey
    artist: Toni Basil
    notes:
      - The one song that manages to sound '80s while also sounding like a bubblegum pop song
      - That opening line is just so tacky and hilarious
      - Somehow the '80s rock edge actually manages to make this bubblegum pop song sound good; I'm impressed
      - Chorus is kinda catchy; the vocal performance is a little cheesy though
  - title: Maneater
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    notes:
      - A very minimal synthpop song
      - That bass line is so badass sounding
      - I really like the swingy rhythm; suits the song very well
      - Great vocal performace; that chorus is very catchy
      - Amazing sax solo in the middle, just fantastic
