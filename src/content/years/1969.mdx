commentary: Another year of "hit or miss"; it was either a legendary song or a complete dud. Either way that's gonna wrap up the '60s decade. We went from dawdling dop-wops to LSD-induced space-westerns in a span of a decade; let's see how the '70s fare!
year: 1969
numberOnes:
  - title: I Heard It Through the Grapevine
    artist: Marvin Gaye
    notes:
      - I absolutely love that main riff; so damn gritty
      - Outstanding vocals from Gaye, so glad he's now topping the charts!
  - title: Crimson & Clover
    artist: Tommy James & the Shondells
    notes:
      - A laid back, psychedelic rock song that picks up the pace towards the middle
      - I really wish more songs had a guitar with a tremolo; it sounds so good!
      - There's even a tremolo effect on the vocals towards the end! Far out!
  - title: Everyday People
    artist: Sly & the Family Stone
    notes:
      - A nice, upbeat, piano-driven R&B song
      - It feels like the kind of song for a montage in a film where the main character is driving towards some goal
      - A nice message about integration, the band of course being made up of black and white people helps the message quite well
  - title: Dizzy
    artist: Tommy Roe
    notes:
      - Nice drum beat; very catchy and I love that snare drum!
      - Okay, now everyone wants to sound psychedelic; this is a straight-up pop song, but it sounds like they took a page out of the Doors playbook
      - I guess If I had to pick a genre that pop could borrow from, it would be psychedelic rock. It makes an okay song sound good!
  - title: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In
    artist: The 5th Dimension
    notes:
      - Two songs in one; what a deal!
      - "\"Aquarius\" is like some kind of space-themed fever dream turned into a pop song; I'm guessing this would have been a bad trip for some"
      - '"Let The Sunshine" is much better and less weird, but a little too repetitive for my tastes'
      - "This would probably be a fit for a film-score, but as a #1 springtime hit, it ain't it Chief."
  - title: Get Back
    artist: The Beatles w/ Billy Preston
    notes:
      - Even when the Beatles do a straight blues song, they can't help but sound like they are revolutionizing an entire genre
      - George Harrison is such a good guitarist; those solos are too damn good for their own good
      - Let's not leave out Preston's organ solo; also iconic and well-done
  - title: '"Love Theme from Romeo & Juilet'
    artist: Henry Mancini
    notes:
      - A nice little orchestral piece from the 1969 film adapatation of Shakespeare's play
      - As well done as it is, I feel like it would have been better as just a solo-piano piece
  - title: In the Year 2525 (Exordium & Terminus)
    artist: Zager & Evans
    notes:
      - Was this the year of weird ass space-themed LSD trips?!
      - It sounds like a spaghetti-western set in space
      - It's like one big song with nothing but verses; very repetitive aside from a single key-change
  - title: Honky Tonk Women
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    notes:
      - Amazing drum/guitar pairing; very catchy
      - This sound like the pre-cursor to "Shook Me All Night Long" by AC/DC
      - It's hard to believe this was released in 1969, it sounds like it could have come much later
  - title: Sugar, Sugar
    artist: The Archies
    notes:
      - This is probably the single-most bubblegum poppy song I've heard; it's litterly about sugar and honey!
      - As much as I would like to dislike this song, it does it's job a little too well to hate. They had a goal, and they achieved it. Bravo.
  - title: I Can't Get Next to You
    artist: The Temptations
    notes:
      - A very bad-ass Funk song; what else can I say?
      - This is one group where every single member was the master of their craft
  - title: Suspicious Minds
    artist: Elvis Presley
    notes:
      - Elvis is back; he just can't seem to NOT be a famous rockstar
      - He did real well blending the late '60s sound with his iconic style
      - "This probably his best #1 song honestly; just well-rounded and well-performed"
  - title: Wedding Bell Blues
    artist: The 5th Dimension
    notes:
      - Now that we are back on Planet Earth, the 5th Dimension are pretty good at doing Soul
      - It's good, but I can't say it stands out from the other groups we've heard so far
  - title: Come Together/Something
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - Another two'fer! the first two tracks off of Abbey Road
      - If you haven't listened to Abbey Road front-to-back yet, you're doing yourself a diservice
      - I still have my Abbey Road poster I got at my 5th grade Scholastic Book Fair hanging up on my wall
      - "\"Come Together\" is the epitome of badassery and \"Something\" is probably one of the most graceful and vunerable love songs I've ever heard"
  - title: Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye
    artist: Steam
    notes:
      - What's that I hear? A double-kick pedal? I did'nt know Steam was a death metal band!
      - To be honest, it's something I'd only want to hear at a sporting event or a nightclub
  - title: Leaving on a Jet Plane
    artist: Peter, Paul and Mary
    notes:
      - A neat little soft rock/folk song written by John Denver
      - Very pleasant to listen to; easy on the ears
      - Amazing performance
  - title: Someday We'll Be Together
    artist: Diana Ross & The Supremes
    notes:
      - "\"It's the last week of the '60s, let's try and squeeze in another Supremes #1 hit!\" is what America said"
      - A much more restrained performance from the group; I think it suits them well
