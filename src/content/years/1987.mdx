commentary: We've finally arrived at the '90s! Well, sort of. It's clear that the chart toppers of this year are starting to have that '90s sound, and I'm ready to move on. However, we still got 2 more years of this decade, so let's finish strong!
year: 1987
numberOnes:
  - title: Walk Like an Egyptian
    artist: The Bangles
    notes:
      - Upbeat pop-rock song with an Egyptian theme
      - The use of Eastern instrumentation and modes/scales is top-notch; it's probably not super accurate to Egyptian specifically, but it's well done
      - The "Way Ohh Way Ohh Oh Way Ohh Wayyyy Ohhhhh" during the chorus is so singable
      - Awesome guitar solo in the middle as well!
  - title: Shake You Down
    artist: Gregory Abbott
    notes:
      - No, that is NOT the current governor of Texas singing
      - Honestly, this is just a boring R&B song, it's really not that good
  - title: At This Moment
    artist: Billy Vera & The Beaters
    notes:
      - 'Live performance originally recorded in 1981; became a #1 hit after it was featured on the TV show "Family Ties"'
      - It's not a half-bad song; it's sort of a slow, bluesy, piano ballad
      - I can't hate the sax solo in the middle, it's a nice addition
  - title: Open Your Heart
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - Upbeat dance-pop song
      - Nothing really to complain about, it's a decent song. If anything, Madonna had some really good composers working with her
  - title: Livin' On a Prayer
    artist: Bon Jovi
    notes:
      - Glam rock song about a rocky relationship between two working class people
      - 'VH1 put this song at #1 of their "greatest songs of the ''80s" list some years ago. Does it stack up?'
      - I mean, it is indeed a good song, but I don't really concider it THAT legendary
      - That bassline stacked with the talkbox guitar riff is just great
      - I really how the minor-key verses lead into the major-key chorus; really good composition
      - Honestly, the lyrics are pretty good; it's relatable and not really preachy
      - It does suffer from the "key-change-upwards" cliche, unfortunately
  - title: Jacob's Ladder
    artist: Huey Lewis & The News
    notes:
      - Pop-rock song critiqing evangelical preachers, and about living one day at a time; written by Bruce Hornsby
      - I really like this song; especially that chorus "step-by-step, rung-by-rung, climbing Jacob's ladder"
      - Solid guitar work throughout; fits the song well
  - title: Lean on Me
    artist: Club Nouveau
    notes:
      - 'New-jack swing cover of the #1 hit originally done by Bill Withers'
      - I think this was the first '90s hit song; it's pretty much sounds at least 3 years ahead of it's time
      - This might be sacrilege, but I actually like this version better then the orignal. It takes the soft, somber, interpersonal orignal and turns it into an upbeat anthem of friendship and helping others
      - I think the little breakdown in the middle with the reggae "we be jamin'!" refrain is great
  - title: Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now
    artist: Starship
    notes:
      - Power ballad featured in the film "Mannequin"
      - It's not terrible, but it's really nothing too special; standard affair for a power ballad
      - I will give it credit for doing the "key-change-upwards" gracefully; it sounds natural and fits the song
  - title: I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)
    artist: Aretha Franklin & George Michael
    notes:
      - It only took 20 years, but Franklin's back on top! this time with George Michael
      - Franklin and Michael have good vocal chemistry; probably the best duet we've heard so far this decade
      - Pretty solid song; good to see when a plan comes together!
  - title: (I Just) Died In Your Arms
    artist: Cutting Crew
    notes:
      - New wave/pop rock song about... well... a phenomenon called "la petite mort". I'll let you look that one up
      - The chorus is fantastic; It does a good job of serving the song
      - I really like that guitar solo in the middle; so somber yet fits the upbeat nature of the song
  - title: With or Without You
    artist: U2
    notes:
      - 'Irish new wave/pop rock band scores their first #1 hit'
      - I really love how simple this song is; it using the "4 chords" of pop, but with that bassline, quiet synths, and vulnerable lyrics, it's probably one of the best "simple" songs I've heard so far
      - When that delayed guitar riff comes in; it just sends this song into the clouds. The Edge is a great guitarist
      - This all builds up to that crescendo after the second chorus, which is just amazing song composition
  - title: You Keep Me Hangin' On
    artist: Kim Wilde
    notes:
      - 'Synth-pop cover of the #1 hit song from 1966, originally performed by The Supremes'
      - Unlike "Venus" by Bananarama, I feel like the synth-pop aesthetic doesn't really fit the song all that well
      - That's not to take away from the talent of Kim Wilde, but this is far from her best work
  - title: Always
    artist: Atlantic Starr
    notes:
      - Slow R&B ballad
      - the vocal performances are good, but the song itself really isn't anything special; standard duet ballad
  - title: Head to Toe
    artist: Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam
    notes:
      - Another '90s-sounding hit song from 1987
      - Has a Motown funk feel to it; kinda neat
      - Wow, I was not expecting a guitar solo in the middle; it's pretty good too!
      - It's a decent song; it does kind of drag on for 5 minutes though
  - title: I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - This song really abuses the hell out of that Roland drum machine... and that's not a bad thing!
      - Amazing vocal performance from Houston; probably her best so far
  - title: Alone
    artist: Heart
    notes:
      - Soft rock ballad
      - I just can't figure out why people were so obsessed with Heart at this stage in their career; THIS has NOTHING on songs like "Barracuda" or "Crazy On You"
      - Just another boring ballad; I will say it's better than their last one, but not by much
  - title: Shakedown
    artist: Bob Seger
    notes:
      - Very upbeat synth rock song written for the film Beverly Hills Cop II
      - Insanely driving; definitely a driving song for sure
      - That chorus is so catchy; very well-written
      - Not a half-bad guitar solo either!
  - title: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For
    artist: U2
    notes:
      - "Very similar to their last #1 hit, but this time it's much more cheery"
      - Very good vocal performance by Bono
      - This is the kind of song to listen to when your in a bad mood; to lift your spirits up!
  - title: Who's That Girl
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - Insanely similar to her previous single "La Isla Bonita"
      - Wow, this one's pretty lame; the phoned-in latin influence, the half-assed spanish lyrics, the repetitive nature of the song; it's a real shame because Madonna and company are much better than this
  - title: La Bamba
    artist: Los Lobos
    notes:
      - Chicano rock cover of the 1958 hit song by Richie Valens (One of three musicians that died on "The Day The Music Died". Recorded for the biopic of the same name
      - Very faithful to the original; I'm sure Richie Valens would be proud
      - 'Unlike the last #1 song, this one is sung in spanish by people who actaully know spanish!'
      - That guitar solo in the middle is so good!
  - title: I Just Can't Stop Loving You
    artist: Michael Jackson with Siedah Garrett
    notes:
      - 'First #1 hit from Michael Jackson''s album "Bad"; love duet'
      - Honestly, this is such a weak performance; Jackson is so much better than this, but I guess he had to pad-out the album with something
  - title: Didn't We Almost Have It All
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - Slow R&B ballad
      - You know, if it wasn't for Houston's amazing vocal performance, this would just be another lame ballad. It's crazy to think how one person's voice can carry a whole damn song
  - title: Here I Go Again
    artist: Whitesnake
    notes:
      - Glam metal power ballad; originally recorded as a blues rock song in 1982, re-recorded to fit the glam metal scene
      - I do like the chorus; it's pretty good
      - If you bother to listen to album this song is on, listen to "Still of the Night". It's the much better single compared to this one. This one's just kind of "ok"
  - title: Lost In Emotion
    artist: Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam
    notes:
      - Oh shit, that bassline intro is tasty as hell
      - Okay, that "hit the beat now..." line is friggin' hilarious; it's so soft and lacks the punch a line like that one should have
      - Besides that bassline, this song is just really boring. This should have been recorded as an upbeat club song, not this dawdling mid-tempo ballad
  - title: Bad
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - '"Billie Jean" may have been Jackson''s magnum opus, but I always thought this was his most fun song'
      - That bassline line, those synth leads, that drum machine; it's just perfect
      - Also another amazing chorus; very singable
      - Jackson was probably one of leading figures to popularize "bad" as a positive adjective from this time period
  - title: I Think We're Alone Now
    artist: Tiffany
    notes:
      - Teeny bopper cover of an old "Tommy James & The Shondells" song; recorded when Tiffany was just 15-years-old
      - It's got a nice upbeat feel; that bassline is kind of good
      - Overall, it's okay; nothing too special
  - title: Mony Mony
    artist: Billy Idol
    notes:
      - Wow, 2 "Tommy James & The Shondells" covers in a row! This one's the live version, not the one recorded in 1981 that everyone knows
      - I like this live performance; it's got a punk rock feel to it, which makes sense considering Idol's punk roots
      - Despite that, I still think the 1981 version that Idol did was better
  - title: (I've Had) The Time of My Life
    artist: Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes
    notes:
      - Love theme written for the film "Dirty Dancing"
      - I like the use of strings on this one; it's nice to hear those after the onslaught of synths so far this decade
      - Not a half-bad sax solo either!
      - It's a well composed song, but I honestly think it's just "ok"; I really don't know why this song has the legacy it does
  - title: Heaven Is a Place on Earth
    artist: Belinda Carlisle
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo power ballad
      - I like the reverb on the vocals, really fits the "angelic" theme of the song
      - I like the chorus; either than that, it's nothing too special
  - title: Faith
    artist: George Michael
    notes:
      - Crossover of '50s rock and '80s pop
      - I really like the church organ intro and how it dry cuts into that Bo Diddley rhythm
      - Great vocal performance from Michael; just solid work throughout
      - Perfectly timed electric and steel guitar solo; well-composed
      - Do yourself a favor and DO NOT listen to the cover of this song by Limp Bizkit
