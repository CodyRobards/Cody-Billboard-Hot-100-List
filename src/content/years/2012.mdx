commentary: Another slight improvement. As each year goes on, the better the mixes become. It's like producers are starting to understand that cranking up your instruments to 11 doesn't equal a good song. It's also cool to see how indie music is influencing the pop scene. I look forward to next year!
year: 2012
numberOnes:
  - title: Sexy and I Know It
    artist: LMFAO
    notes:
      - Another Electro-pop song by LMFAO
      - The rap verses are very silly, plus the "I work out!" refrain and the "wigglewigglewiggle" line
      - Basically the same song as "Party Rock Anthem", just a bit more silly
  - title: We Found Love
    artist: Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris
    notes:
      - Electro-dance song
      - Good electric piano hook; very catchy
      - Rihanna's vocal performance is really on-point here
      - Can't have an early 2010s club song without a bass drop
      - I think this is a great song, but it suffers from over-production like many songs of it's era
  - title: Set Fire to the Rain
    artist: Adele
    notes:
      - This one's very similar to "Someone Like You" but a bit more upbeat
      - Solid pre-chorus and chorus; great vocal performance by Adele
      - Great outro; good to see someone putting in the effort to make the last 30 seconds of a song great
      - "I like this one, but I think her previous #1 hits from last year were better"
  - title: Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)
    artist: Kelly Clarkson
    notes:
      - Meh, a bog-standard pop song; I guess Clarkson's vocal performance is good, but not enough to make up for the loud-mix
  - title: We Are Young
    artist: fun. feat. Janelle Monáe
    notes:
      - Indie pop song; blew up after it was featured in the TV show Glee and in a Super Bowl commercial
      - The military rhythm is kinda neat
      - Whoa, the slows down the bpm after the first verse; interesting musical choice for a pop song
      - The vocal performance is pretty solid
      - I really like when Monáe's part comes in; when all of the vocal parts come in and stack
      - Interesting song, but it's really nothing too special; there are definitely better indie songs
  - title: Somebody That I Used to Know
    artist: Gotye feat. Kimbra
    notes:
      - Speaking of better indie songs...
      - I really love that acoustic-guitar riff; plus an honest-to-God xylophone!
      - The sublety of the instruments throughout the whole song is just great
      - Great chorus; very powerful vocal performance
      - Wow, I'm impressed by Kimbra's verse; the way it flows into the chorus is just great composition
  - title: Call Me Maybe
    artist: Carly Rae Jepsen
    notes:
      - Teeny-bopper song
      - It's like a much better version of "Girlfriend" by Avril Lavigne; better composition overall
      - Solid chorus; I like the use of those orchestral stabs
      - I'm just glad to hear a modern pop song with proper mixing
  - title: Whistle
    artist: Flo Rida
    notes:
      - '"Will you blow my whistle baby?" NOT AT ALL a sexual innuendo'
      - I guess the acoustic-guitar is kinda neat
      - Solid flows by Flo Rida; can't complain
      - "Probably the closest thing to a novelty #1 song we've heard in this new millennium"
  - title: We Are Never Getting Back Together
    artist: Taylor Swift
    notes:
      - Country star turned pop star; I guess if it worked for Kenny Rodgers and Dolly Parton, I guess it could work for Swift
      - I really like that guitar riff; can't say the same for the insufferable bubblegum pop lyrics
      - Solid vocal performance by Swift, not enough to make up for the tackiness of the song
  - title: One More Night
    artist: Maroon 5
    notes:
      - "NOT a cover of the Phil Collins #1 hit song"
      - Fun fact, this was the song that kept "Gangnam Style" by Psy out of the top spot; it was at this point that Billboard decided to include YouTube views into their determinations from here on out
      - Wow, it's actually kinda funky
      - Catchy chorus; plus those drums are on-point
  - title: Diamonds
    artist: Rihanna
    notes:
      - Meh, it's alright; kinda of a bog-standard pop song, honestly
  - title: Locked Out Of Heaven
    artist: Bruno Mars
    notes:
      - Funk rock song
      - The "whoop whoop whoop whoop, ooh!" line that is repeated throughout the whole song is kinda tacky
      - The laid back rhythm is refreshing to hear
      - I really wish the chorus didn't have that electronic rhythm; I think it would sound better if it stuck to the dry instrumentation
      - Mars' vocals are top-notch on this one, I gotta admit
