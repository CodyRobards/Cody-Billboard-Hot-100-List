commentary: "...aaaannnndddd now we are back down at the bottom. NOT a good year. Most of these songs suffer from an overdone and generic production. \"Yeah, just throw up a basic 808 beat, some cheap built-in synths, crank that shit up to 11 with not proper mixing, and call it a day... that's all it takes to make a #1 hit!\" Said every producer in 2008; really wishing for 2006/07 Timbaland to come back..."
year: 2008
numberOnes:
  - position: 1
    title: Low
    artist: Flo Rida feat. T-Pain
    notes:
      - Crunk song; I first remember hearing this song watching Tom Cruise dancing to this in Tropic Thunder
      - Who knew that speeding up crunk made it better?
      - T-Pain is having too much fun on this one
      - Flo Rida's pretty solid on this one; he's got talent, that's for sure
  - position: 2
    title: Love in This Club
    artist: Usher feat. Young Jeezy
    notes:
      - Elecro-R&B; has this skittish "4-Chords" progression
      - Young Jeezy's verse is really out of place here; he's got this very hoarse and aggressive style when this is supposed to be a a love song
      - It's nice and upbeat, but I can't help but think this song is severely lacking in substance
  - position: 3
    title: Bleeding Love
    artist: Leona Lewis
    notes:
      - Another "4-Chords" progression song; R&B ballad
      - Lewis is trying really hard to sound like Mariah Carey here; it's not bad by any means, but it's very obvious
      - The chorus is pretty solid; can't say much else about the song
  - position: 4
    title: Touch My Body
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Speaking of Mariah Carey...
      - Oh god, I remember this song... I first heard this song sung in a video by a japanese guy in very poor english... so I guess this was a real song afer all!
      - "Never though this late in here career she would release her most provocative song; also this is clearly some kind of joke song she made that somehow became a #1 hit. The lyrics are kinda silly and the music video that accompanys the song is pretty friggin' hilarious"
      - Oh yeah, I guess the songs pretty good too
  - position: 5
    title: Lollipop
    artist: Lil' Wayne feat. Static Major
    notes:
      - "Hip hop song; another posthumous #1 hit, released shortly after Static Major's death"
      - Holy shit... Lil' Wayne is like... trying REAL hard to sound ridiculous on this one. and the warbly autotune just make it even worse
      - The half-assed electric-guitar sprinkled throughout the song is also pretty bad too, and I'm not even refering to Wayne's piss-poor attempts to play this live on guitar. I mean the actual mix has this terrible guitar lick that plays
      - Honestly, Static Major is the only good thing about this song
  - position: 6
    title: Take a Bow
    artist: Rihanna
    notes:
      - Man, we really are going hard this year with the "4-Chords" songs...
      - Meh, it's okay. It's probably the most sterile and vanilla R&B song to use this progression I've heard so far
  - position: 7
    title: Viva la Vida
    artist: Coldplay
    notes:
      - Interesting, a "Baroque pop" song; heavy use of strings on this one
      - Besides Chris Martin's vocal performance being good; the whole song just kind of drags on. It feels like it's building up to something, but there really isn't a pay-off of any kind
  - position: 8
    title: I Kissed a Girl
    artist: Katy Perry
    notes:
      - Nothing like a song about a sexually repressed girl discovering that she might be a lesbian!
      - I guess I got to give Katy Perry some credit for trying to make a gay anthem, but it just comes off so fake, like "Hey! I'm a lesbian! Ain't I just sooo quirky?!"
      - The production and mixing is so plastic and fake-sounding that it really brings the song down
  - position: 9
    title: Disturbia
    artist: Rihanna
    notes:
      - Electro-pop song about being mentally disturbed; written by Chris Brown
      - Actually, this song makes more sense when you consider the fact that it was written by Chris Brown...
      - I don't know, it's catchy and upbeat, but it's really nothing too special
  - position: 10
    title: Whatever You Like
    artist: T.I.
    notes:
      - Pop rap song
      - Bah, another basic, boring, love rap song
  - position: 11
    title: So What
    artist: Pink
    notes:
      - Pop rock song
      - Wow, this is some of the most try-hard "I'm edgy and cool! I'm a rockstar!" lyrics I've ever heard. It's a like the ramblings of a drunk white girl
      - The production is also overbearing and generic as hell
  - position: 12
    title: Live Your Life
    artist: T.I. feat. Rihanna
    notes:
      - Oh god... this samples the "Numa Numa" meme song...
      - Very upbeat and driven; has this optimistic feel to it
      - T.I.'s flow and lyrics are actually pretty solid; not a half-bad message either
      - Rihanna really owns that chorus and  bridge section; elevates the song
  - position: 13
    title: Womanizer
    artist: Britney Spears
    notes:
      - Jesus, can we please get a song that DOESN'T have a plastic and sterile production?
      - I guess I like the decending synth riff during the chorus, but everything about this song is just lame
  - position: 14
    title: Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)
    artist: Beyoncé
    notes:
      - "\"Yo, Taylor... I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the BEST music videos of ALL TIME!\" said Kayne West during one of his manic episodes at the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards"
      - It's great to hear another fantastic vocal performace by Beyoncé, but unfortunately this song suffers from an over-bearing and noisey production
