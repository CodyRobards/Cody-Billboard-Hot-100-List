commentary: "This was the single greatest \"meh\" year so far, and I don't mean that to be derogatory; it was really just super-average. This is the first year where none of the songs were added to my Best or Worst #1 hits list (which you'll get to see when I'm finished). That's how average this year was. Besides that, I think this was the best year for disco as a whole, but that's not saying much since, as a genre, I don't think it's all that great to begin with. I just can't wait for the '80s to show up already so I can move on."
year: 1978
numberOnes:
  - title: How Deep Is Your Love
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - Slow soft rock ballad
      - This actually pretty good; the vocals are fantastic throughout; especially during the chorus
      - Those synth chords are just nice and pleasant to listen to
  - title: Baby Come Back
    artist: Player
    notes:
      - A nice smooth sounding funk/soft rock song
      - That straight beat on drums plus that bass line is great
      - Great guitar work throughout
  - title: Stayin' Alive
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - Great bass line; very iconic
      - The vocals on the chorus have a nice rhythmic quality to it; I like it
      - It's a good song; I would probably like this song more if it wasn't overplayed on the radio
  - title: (Love Is) Thicker Than Water
    artist: Andy Gibb
    notes:
      - Two Bee Gees hits in a row! (Well, kind of)
      - Has nice chorus
      - That little guitar solo in the middle is quite pleasant to listen to
      - Not a half bad song; can't say it's anything special
  - title: Night Fever
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - "Bee Gees biggest hit, 8 weeks at #1 and 13 weeks in the top 10"
      - Has a nice bouncy feel to it; very well-done
      - Favorite part is the post-chrous bit; kind of sounds heavy
      - Can't say much else, just a solid song
  - title: If I Can't Have You
    artist: Yvonne Elliman
    notes:
      - Oh wow, this was written by the Bee Gees also, that makes 5 Bee Gees hits out of 6 so far this year!
      - Maybe it's worth mentioning that all of these songs were in Saturday Night Fever...
      - This one's alright; it's not half-bad, but it ain't anything too special
  - title: With a Little Luck
    artist: Paul McCartney & Wings
    notes:
      - I have no clue how Paul had so many hits with his band Wings, they are so hit-or-miss...
      - This one's a miss for me, way to plain and boring for my liking
  - title: Too Much, Too Little, Too Late
    artist: Johnny Mathis & Deniece Williams
    notes:
      - R&B duet
      - Honestly, this one's just lame; I can't say I like Williams voice.
  - title: You're the One That I Want
    artist: John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John
    notes:
      - Song from the movie Grease
      - It's nice and upbeat enough
      - It's very clear that Travolta is not a singer and Newton-John is; it's night-and-day
      - Another okay song; it's catchy but nothing too special
  - title: Shadow Dancing
    artist: Andy Gibb
    notes:
      - Wow, a minor-key disco song; sounds gritty
      - Real funky chorus; I like it
      - Just a solid funk/disco song; better than the other Bee Gees songs I think
  - title: Miss You
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    notes:
      - Hard Rock/Disco song
      - Great instrumentation throughout; especially the sax solo towards the end
      - Honestly, it's just an okay song; They do a good job of combining their sound with disco, but they can only go so far with it
  - title: Three Times A Lady
    artist: The Commodores
    notes:
      - "Slow piano ballad; first #1 hit for Lionel Ritchie"
      - 'I always thoughout the chorus was funny to listen to: "once... twice... three times a laaaddddy"'
      - It's not half-bad; it manages to be a real slow song and NOT put me to sleep. Good job, Lionel!
  - title: Grease
    artist: Frankie Valli
    notes:
      - Another song from the film Grease... well it is the title track after all
      - I really like that chorus the way the backing vocals play off the vocals from Valli is good
      - Honestly, Frankie Valli is a surprising case where a pop star gets better as their career goes on; his voice has gotten much better since the doo-wop days
  - title: Boogie Oogie Oogie
    artist: A Taste of Honey
    notes:
      - Amazing guitar and bass on this one; the two female singers are actually the ones playing!
      - It's great to see a disco artist play to the strengths of the genre; it's like they set out to make a banger
  - title: Kiss You All Over
    artist: Exile
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo rock song
      - Nice synth chord-progression
      - I like the little guitar bits throughout
      - Not a half-bad song
  - title: Hot Child in the City
    artist: Nick Gilder
    notes:
      - Power pop-rock song
      - Sounds like a poppier version of David Bowie; I kind of like it
      - Neat chorus; I like those little synth chords
      - Nice guitar work throughout the song
  - title: You Needed Me
    artist: Anne Murray
    notes:
      - Soft love ballad
      - It's just a "meh" song; it's one of the most plain songs I've ever heard
  - title: MacArthur Park
    artist: Donna Summer
    notes:
      - Disco cover of an orchestral pop song from 1967
      - I kind of like how it starts off slow but then get's faster after a minute or so
      - The song's urgency feels kinda forced; I actually think it would be better slower
      - Besides Summer's amazing vocal range, the song is just "alright"
  - title: You Don't Bring Me Flowers
    artist: Barbra Streisand & Neil Diamond
    notes:
      - Love ballad duet
      - The performances are very good, but the song itself is kind of "meh"
  - title: Le Freak
    artist: Chic
    notes:
      - The single greatest funk guitar riff ever written; Nile Rodgers is the king
      - 'Fun Fact: They originally wanted the refrain to be "Fuck Off!" but had to settle for "Freak Out!" for it to be radio-friendly'
      - Let's also not ignore the fantastic bass and drums on this song as well
      - This otherwise be just an okay song if it weren't for the amazing instrumentation
