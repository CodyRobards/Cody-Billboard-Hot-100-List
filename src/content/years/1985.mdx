commentary: A decent year; THIS was the year of the synthpop/new wave hit song, and I do not mind that at all. Some of my favorites I've heard so far are in this year alone. Overall, I enjoyed this year.
year: 1985
numberOnes:
  - title: Like a Virgin
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - "The first of a truck-load of #1 hits Madonna would have throughout her whole career"
      - ...and it's alright. I kind of like the main synth-line and the chord progression is good, but it's nothing too special
      - I can't say I've ever liked Madonna's voice, but she sounds good enough. It's not like she's warbbling all over the place or anything, so I got to give her credit for that XD
  - title: I Want to Know What Love Is
    artist: Foreigner
    notes:
      - Slow synth ballad
      - I love the sound of that synth; so haunting
      - Very powerful pre-chorus and chorus; especially when the choir comes in at the end of the song
      - A solid power ballad; I guess having '70s rock chops automatically makes you good at writing songs outside of your wheelhouse
  - title: Careless Whisper
    artist: Wham! feat. George Michael
    notes:
      - I have no clue as to why Michael is considered a featured artist to his own group. That'd be like "Queen feat. Freddie Mercury"
      - Anyway, probably one of the most recognizable songs from the '80s plus one of the most recognizable sax riffs ever
      - I do like the groove of the song; it doesn't go overboard at any time; it's on point!
      - I feel like this is what Lionel Richie was trying to go for with "Hello", but failed to do so
      - Overall a good song; can't figure out why this has such a legacy. It's good, but I don't think it's anything too special
  - title: Can't Fight This Feeling
    artist: REO Speedwagon
    notes:
      - Another power ballad from REO
      - This has much more piano in it. I actually think it has a good progession; they are definitely talented
      - A good ballad; If the world had to pick only one act to be the sole-ballad songwriter, I think these guys would be on the table for sure
  - title: One More Night
    artist: Phil Collins
    notes:
      - Synthpop ballad
      - Surprisingly minimal; just vocals synths, and a single drum machine on loop
      - I really like Phil Collins, one of my favorite pop stars, but I can't say I like this one all that much. It's like he's trying to be reallll smooth-sounding, but it comes off so tacky
  - title: We Are The World
    artist: U.S.A. For Africa
    notes:
      - A whole bunch of pop stars came together to record a song to raise money for African humanitarian aid; written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson
      - By the way, this was one of two charity songs that inspired the formation of Live Aid a few months later
      - This actually has quite a diverse cast; Stevie Wonder, Kenny Rogers, Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan... friggin' Dan Aykroyd! What the Hell!?
      - Every soloist's contribution is actually pretty good; they all bring their own flavor to the song. My favorite is toss-up between Kenny Loggins and Ray Charles
      - It's actually a decent song; I guess when you bring together a whole bunch of artists, you're bound to have everyone's contribution lead to something decent
  - title: Crazy for You
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - Synthpop song written for the film "Vision Quest"
      - I really like the progession of the song; surprisingly upbeat
      - Madonna's vocal performace is good; not completely overdone
      - Not a half-bad song, but nothing to write home about
  - title: Don't You (Forget About Me)
    artist: Simple Minds
    notes:
      - Synthpop/new wave song
      - The subtle synths and guitars under the verses is so good; really complements the song very well
      - The vocal performance on this song if phenomenal; so restrained and vunerable and then on that last chorus, Jim Kerr hits you with that power... legendary!
      - That drum beat is also great; so driving and on point!
      - If you've seen the episode of Futurama called "The Luck of the Fryish", then this song might elicit some emotions in some people
  - title: Everything She Wants
    artist: Wham!
    notes:
      - That drum machine is so catchy; and then those synths come in... just great!
      - Those hums, ho's and la's during the pre-chorus sound so good
      - Probably the closest a standard '80s pop song can be to great while maintaining the sound that will eventually date it
  - title: Everybody Wants to Rule the World
    artist: Tears for Fears
    notes:
      - Synthpop song
      - Amazing vocals on this song, so much power and precision
      - That staggered drum beat is just phenomenal
      - That bridge when the guitar comes in, amazing!
      - The little synth break before the first guitar solo really sends this song into the stratosphere
      - The construction of this song is so on-point that it isn't even funny; so many layers of this song stack to create something great
  - title: Heaven
    artist: Bryan Adams
    notes:
      - Power ballad from everyone's favorite Canadian rock star
      - I really like that chorus; sounds good!
      - Great guitar solo in the middle; fits the song well
      - I'm impressed at how quickly ballads improved in quality. Every ballad so far this year is managing to not put me to sleep xD
  - title: Sussudio
    artist: Phil Collins
    notes:
      - An onslaught of '80s sounds; drum machines, synths, and samples hit your senses in a dance-fueled craze!
      - Phil's voice is so on-point here, plus that reverb effect on his voice really makes this song great
      - Honestly, this song rocks. It takes all of the best elements of the '80s sound and cranks it up to 11
  - title: A View to a Kill
    artist: Duran Duran
    notes:
      - Written for the opening credits sequence for the James Bond film of the same name
      - "Funny story how this song came about: The band was at a party with the producer of the film, and then the bassist John Taylor drunkenly asked if they could do the theme song for the film and then that same night, they were writing it but they all passed out and almost forgot about it the next morning!"
      - It's actually a great song; Duran Duran do a good job of fusing the Bond theme style with their own.
      - The chorus is so good; it just screams "Bond!"
  - title: Every Time You Go Away
    artist: Paul Young
    notes:
      - Synth ballad written Daryl Hall of "Hall & Oates"
      - An '80s pop song with a sitar in it? It's like George Harrison walked in to record this!
      - Good vocals from Young; nothing legendary, but still pretty solid
      - Solid instrumentation throughout; it can't shake that '80s production tackiness, but it runs with it so well that it mitigates it
  - title: Shout
    artist: Tears For Fears
    notes:
      - Synthpop song about political protest
      - Those industrial drums, It's almost like I'm listening to a Depeche Mode song from the '90s; way ahead of it's time!
      - "This song is so damn gritty and edgy, I'm surprised that became a #1 hit in a mostly edgeless '80s landscape"
      - That little synth solo in the middle; just amazing!
      - That guitar solo at the end... one of the few solos that give me goosebumps. Perfection.
  - title: The Power Of Love
    artist: Huey Lewis & The News
    notes:
      - Wow, we went from proto-'90s grittyness to edgeless '80s pop rock in a single week!
      - Written for the movie "Back to the Future"
      - Very catchy and bluesy; really blends '80s synthpop with blue rock very well
      - I really love that bridge; the vocals with those guitar chords. It's sooo good!
      - Also an absolute banger of a guitar solo
  - title: "\"St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"
    artist: John Parr
    notes:
      - "'80s rock ballad written for the film of the same name"
      - I think this is the first ballad dud... it's just so overdone. Every instrument is cranked up to 11, and not balanced or mixed at all
      - Eh, it's just "meh". Not something to get excited about when it comes on the radio
  - title: Money For Nothing
    artist: Dire Straits
    notes:
      - Blue rock group from England write a song poking fun of the vapidness of the MTV generation
      - That synth swell and drums leading into that iconic guitar riff... absolutely legendary
      - THIS is how to do a blue rock song; top-notch
      - I don't know what else to say; it's just a fantastic song!
  - title: Oh Sheila
    artist: Ready For The World
    notes:
      - This is NOT a Prince song. I know it sounds like one, but it isn't. However, does it stack up to him?
      - Kind of. It definitely embodies all of the characteristics of the Minneapolis-sound that Prince popularized, but I can't say it's Prince-tier
      - It is very catchy though; I guess making a Minneapolis-sound song by default bumps it up a few notches
  - title: Take On Me
    artist: a-ha
    notes:
      - Another iconic synthpop/new wave song; probably more well-known by it's music video that looks like a comic-book sketch came to life
      - That drum machine is sooo driving; I think I know why they made the music video race-car themed
      - Also, that synthline is just perfect; suits the song too well
      - Great vocal range on the singer; definitely the kind of thing that every drunk patreon of a bar during karaoke night tries to sing but fails miserably at
      - That chromatic synth run during the bridge is just fantastic
  - title: Saving All My Love for You
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - Slow R&B ballad written back in 1978
      - It definitely sounds like it was written in the '70s, but grafted onto an '80s artists... that's not a bad thing though!
      - Houston's voice is really good on this one; it's a shame how she died
  - title: Part-Time Lover
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    notes:
      - "Stevie Wonder's last #1 hit of his career"
      - Okay this one is literally hard to listen to; The drums are way to loud and the drum machine is going way too fast
      - Man, Stevie Wonder really phone it in this decade; a darn shame since he was so good last decade
  - title: Miami Vice Theme
    artist: Jan Hammer
    notes:
      - Instrumental theme for the TV show of the same name
      - "\"Hey Hammer, can you write me us a theme song for this TV show we got? Oh, and can you make it so '80s sounding that that's all people will remember it for?\""
      - Really not all that good; a far-cry from the quality of "Theme from Shaft"
  - title: We Built This City
    artist: Starship
    notes:
      - Oh, how the mighty have fallen... from Jefferson Airplane, to Jefferson Starship, to just Starship; not a single founding member is present here
      - Could this be concidered a Jefferson Airplane song? This band would be a great case-study for the "Ship of Theseus" thought-experiment
      - I will say that it's a superb and well-done synthpop song, but what ruins it is the lyrics about rejecting "corporation games" while sounding like the most corporate-sounding pop music ever written
  - title: Seperate Lives
    artist: Phil Collins & Marilyn Martin
    notes:
      - Love ballad duet written for the film "White Nights"
      - Honestly, it's real boring; I can see why you never hear it on the radio or talked about when people reminisce about music from the '80s
  - title: Broken Wings
    artist: Mr. Mister
    notes:
      - Synth rock song
      - I can't say I dislike the synths on this one; the way that they linger over the song is nice and forboding
      - The wash of sounds towards the end is kind of nice, but I do think it's a little overboard
  - title: Say You, Say Me
    artist: Lionel Richie
    notes:
      - Love ballad written also written for the flim "White Nights"
      - Okay, this song has one of the most needless bridges I've ever heard; it does not fit the song AT ALL
      - Bah, another slow boring song; this one just drags on for 4 minutes; feels like an eternity
