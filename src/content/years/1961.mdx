commentary_excerpt: This year was quite lackluster honestly. Some good hits here and there, but a lot of "meh". Funny that the best song was an old slave work song

numberOnes:
  - title: Are You Lonesome Tonight?
    artist: Elvis Presley
    notes:
      - A nice and pleasent song from the King
      - Reminds me the Ink Spots, you can tell they were an influence on Elvis
  - title: Wonderland by Night
    artist: Bert Kaempfert
    notes:
      - Nice and slow Instrumental piece
      - The trumpet's a little over bearing at the start, but is good nonetheless
  - title: Will You Love Me Tomorrow
    artist: The Shirelles
    notes:
      - All-female R&B singing group
      - Overall a pretty solid R&B Song, not much else to say
  - title: Calcutta
    artist: Lawrence Welk
    notes:
      - Instrumental version of a German pop song
      - Organ and Accordions galore! Not too bad of a hook
      - The forced "la, la, la" in the background are kind of funny to listen to
  - title: Pony Time
    artist: Chubby Checker
    notes:
      - It sounds like he tried to emulate "The Twist" but with different lyrics
      - Seems like a tamer version of "The Twist"; surprised people still bought it
  - title: Surrender
    artist: Elvis Presley
    notes:
      - It sounds like the James Bond theme sung by Elvis
      - It's kind of neat to hear Elvis try a different style that he's not used to
  - title: Blue Moon
    artist: The Marcels
    notes:
      - Easily the most overdone doo-wop version of Blue Moon I've ever heard
      - The backing vocals are so comically exagerated, that I can't tell if it's a joke or not
  - title: Runaway
    artist: Del Shannon
    notes:
      - The oldest song I can remember being played on Kono 101.1FM when they used to be an oldies station years ago
      - The "why, why, why, why" lyric is impressive, but kind of sounds like the grown-ups from The Peanuts
      - The high-pitched Thermin(?) solo is a little jarring but kind of fits the song
  - title: Mother-in-Law
    artist: Ernie K-Doe
    notes:
      - Funny song topic, but performed well enough
      - '"Mother-in-Law" is repeated a little too often, kind of wish they had better filler lyrics'
  - title: Travelin' Man
    artist: Ricky Nelson
    notes:
      - Kind of a silly song, this guy gets around if you know what I mean...
      - An honest-to-god guitar solo, took long enough for a song to have one
  - title: Running Scared
    artist: Roy Orbison
    notes:
      - The staggered marching cadence helps build up the song well
      - Roy sounds like he's the verge of tears... and I'm not knocking that
  - title: Moody River
    artist: Pat Boone
    notes:
      - Almost sounds a '90s alt rock song with the chord progression
      - Can't say much else either than that it's performed well enough
  - title: Quarter to Three
    artist: Gary U.S. Bonds
    notes:
      - Very catchy; A real good clap-along song
      - Half-decent Sax solo
  - title: Tossin and Turnin
    artist: Bobby Lewis
    notes:
      - The doubled Sax/Trumpet solo is neat
      - "An okay R&B song, no clue as to why it was #1 for 7 weeks straight but whatever"
  - title: Wooden Heart
    artist: Joe Dowell
    notes:
      - Well at least they tried to make the electric organ work with this song
      - Too simple of a rhythm section; I'm gonna fall asleep
  - title: Michael
    artist: The Highwaymen
    notes:
      - An old African-American spiritual/work song
      - Done quite well, good vocals all around
      - Very soulful
  - title: Take Good Care of My Baby
    artist: Bobby Vee
    notes:
      - Good vocal performance overall
      - Still kind of run-of-the-mill love song
  - title: Hit the Road Jack
    artist: Ray Charles
    notes:
      - The "no more, no more, no more, no more" line is addicting
      - The decending bass line is just too good
  - title: Runaround Sue
    artist: Dion
    notes:
      - Very catchy, clap-along song
      - Dion's "whoa" vocal is just great
      - Such a simple song that does so much
  - title: Big Bad John
    artist: Jimmy Dean
    notes:
      - Story-telly song about a miner
      - It's kind of like a spoken-word/rap song... which is funny cause it's clearly a country song
      - Not too bad for a novelty song
  - title: Please Mr. Postman
    artist: The Marvelettes
    notes:
      - Opening line is very singable
      - Standard doo-wop number
  - title: The Lion Sleeps Tonight
    artist: The Tokens
    notes:
      - The lyric "Oh-weem-ah-wep" as silly as it sounds is very singable
      - The lead vocal is very good, despite sounding very silly
      - Great Tenor Sax solo in the middle
