commentary: Okay, so that was the '70s. Some good, but a lot of "meh" to straight-up bad. If anyone is nostalgic for the disco era, I'm not going to take that away from you, that's your's to keep, but I just don't see it as anything else but a musical junk food. Hey, but I guess I'm not one to talk since I like a lot of junk food music as well. Anyway, I'm glad we've made it to the '80s, as I do already like a lot of pop stuff from this decade. Can't wait to see what's in store!
year: 1979
numberOnes:
  - title: Too Much Heaven
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - Slow soft-rock song
      - Good vocal harmony during the chorus
      - It's not bad, but I think of it as lesser follow-up to "How Deep Is Your Love"
  - title: Le Freak
    artist: Chic
    notes:
      - The single greatest funk guitar riff ever written; Nile Rodgers is the king
      - 'Fun Fact: They originally wanted the refrain to be "Fuck Off!" but had to settle for "Freak Out!" for it to be radio-friendly'
      - Let's also not ignore the fantastic bass and drums on this song as well
      - This otherwise be just an okay song if it weren't for the amazing instrumentation
  - title: Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?
    artist: Rod Stewart
    notes:
      - Has a nice gallop-rhythm; haven't seen a lot of that
      - Even a pretty decent synth main-riff as well
      - Did any ladies back in day ACTUALLY think Rod Stewart was sexy? Looking at pictures of him from 1979, he looks as washed-up and aged as any rock star would TWENTY years after their last success, but this was when he was still relevant
  - title: I Will Survive
    artist: Gloria Gaynor
    notes:
      - A neat little premise for a disco song and it's well-done for the most part
      - Another case of "overplayed on the radio"; I wish I could like it more but I just can't
  - title: Tragedy
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - Another minor-key Bee Gees song
      - This one's a bit more rock than disco which is kind of a nice bit of change for a disco group
      - I can't help but think they were creating this epic, larger-than-life song, but I'm just not feeling it
  - title: What a Fool Believes
    artist: The Doobie Brothers
    notes:
      - Song sung by keyboardist of the band, Michael McDonald
      - I always thought this song was kinda ahead of it's time in that each section of the song sounds like it's own song
      - As much of a straight Yacht Rock song it is, I have a soft-spot for this one; it's just a great song and McDonald's performance is outstanding
  - title: Knock on Wood
    artist: Amii Stewart
    notes:
      - Nice use of a drum machine on this one; almost like it could have been made in the '80s
      - This also has a gallop-rhythm as well, I guess this was the year that it became trendy
      - It's an okay song, it kinda just drags on; the only part I think is good is the backing vocals in the middle and at the end
  - title: Heart of Glass
    artist: Blondie
    notes:
      - "Our first New Wave #1 hit; a sign of what's to come in the '80s"
      - I like the distinct drum machine loop running throughout the whole song
      - Blondie's voice during the chorus is pretty good, not so much during the verses; I just think it's a bit overdone
      - It's a good song and a nice break from the more straight-disco stuff, but it's nothing too special; far from their best stuff
  - title: Reunited
    artist: Peaches & Herb
    notes:
      - Slow jazzy R&B duet
      - Both the vocals and instrumentation are surprisingly smooth-sounding
      - It's pleasant to listen to, but it's way too long at almost 6 minutes
  - title: Hot Stuff
    artist: Donna Summer
    notes:
      - Nice little rock/disco crossover
      - Great guitar solo from Steely Dan guitarist, Jeff "Skunk" Baxter
      - It's nice and upbeat; but there's not much too it other than the crossover aspects of it
  - title: Love You Inside Out
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - 'The Bee Gees last #1 hit song; ending their disco reign over the charts'
      - Now this is a Bee Gees song I NEVER hear on the radio; that's a first...
      - That's probably for a reason; this is just a "meh" song. I feel like they phoned this one in
  - title: Ring My Bell
    artist: Anita Ward
    notes:
      - Very upbeat disco song
      - That little "booooooh" sound effect is just distracting and tacky as hell
      - Either than that, it's not a half-bad disco song; nice instrumentation and harmonies
  - title: Bad Girls
    artist: Donna Summer
    notes:
      - Very guitar-driven disco song about prostitutes
      - As silly as the "Toot toot! Hey, beep beep!" refrain is, I like it
      - Good use of horns on this song throughout
      - Overall, a pretty good song
  - title: Good Times
    artist: Chic
    notes:
      - The return the the funk guitar king, Nile Rodgers
      - A nice use of both piano and stings throughout the song
      - 'Fun Fact: this was sampled in the first Rap hit-song, "Rapper''s Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang in the same year'
  - title: My Sharona
    artist: The Knack
    notes:
      - Hard rock song about jailbait (What? that's what this song is about)
      - One of the best guitar riffs of all time; simple, yet very effective at making you wanna jump through a brick wall
      - My God, the way that the drums, bass, and guitar play together during the verses are just perfection
      - 'Not just one, but TWO absolute banger guitar solos, the second one is probably my favorite guitar solo from a #1 hit song'
      - I cannot understate how hard this song ROCKS, it's THE prime example of how to combine hard rock with pop-sensibilities
  - title: Sad Eyes
    artist: Robert John
    notes:
      - Slow pop song that is, believe it or not, is NOT a disco song
      - I like how the vocals are well-harmonized throughout the whole song
      - I really like the chorus; it's very well done
  - title: Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - "Here we are at the first #1 from Michael Jackson as an adult; the start of his reign over the '80s"
      - Honestly, the spoken-word intro is so hilarious. It's like he's trying to sound sensual, but he just sounds like a little kid
      - He's got a pretty good falsetto, but I'm glad he sang in a lower range for most of his future hits; suits him better
      - Catchy chorus; very singable
  - title: Rise
    artist: Herb Alpert
    notes:
      - Jazzy, funk rock instrumental
      - 'Fun Fact: Herb Alpert is the only artist to have an instrumental and a song with vocals reach #1'
      - Man, Herb really is a great trumpeter; I guess that was always his strong suit
      - Just a great instrumental; well-done overall
  - title: Pop Muzik
    artist: M
    notes:
      - 'First synth-pop #1 hit; kind of an experimental song as well'
      - The project is literally just the letter "M"; didn't know you could do that
      - You know, for an early attempt at synth-pop, it's actually well-done; funny lyrics, good cadence, good instrumentation that doesn't sound tacky at all. I'm impressed
  - title: Heartache Tonight
    artist: The Eagles
    notes:
      - Country/Blue Rock song co-written by Bob Seger; the kind of beer-drinkin' song your dad listens to
      - I'm surprised that The Eagles made such a simple song; hardly anything complicated about this one
      - Some pretty solid slide-guitar in this song
      - Not half-bad; just a solid blues rock song
  - title: Still
    artist: The Commodores
    notes:
      - Slow R&B ballad
      - Lionel Ritchie's voice is good on this song, but that's about the only thing worth mentioning; it's just such a plain song
  - title: No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)
    artist: Barbra Streisand & Donna Summer
    notes:
      - Disco duet; Didn't think I'd see Streisand go disco
      - Nursery rhymes in the beginning? Kind of tacky
      - I think this is the most jarring slow-to-fast transition I've heard so far; it was so slow at first, but then it got REAL fast REAL quick
      - I mean it's nothing too special, but at least it's really fast, makes up for it
  - title: Babe
    artist: Styx
    notes:
      - Soft rock piano ballad
      - Really nice twinkly piano keys in the beginning
      - Solid vocal performance from Dennis DeYoung
      - The transition into the guitar solo is a little sudden; maybe they could have eased into it a bit better
      - Another soft-spot song for me, something about it is just great, but I can't put my finger on it
  - title: Escape (The Piña Colada Song)
    artist: Rupert Holmes
    notes:
      - "Last song to reach #1 in the '70s, so let's end it with some yacht rock!"
      - The song's about a guy who starts an affair with a mystery woman in the classifieds
      - ...but SURPRISE! It was his wife he was trying to hookup with in the classifieds ALL ALONG!
      - I guess if you both cheat on each other with yourselves, that's okay and won't tank your marriage AT ALL, I'm sure
      - I mean, did they EVER talk about anything with each other AT ALL during their whole marriage? it took them this long to discover each other?
      - Either than that, it's a decent song; It's actually surprisingly down-to-earth. The characters aren't rock-stars with larger-than-life personalities, but instead just regular people
