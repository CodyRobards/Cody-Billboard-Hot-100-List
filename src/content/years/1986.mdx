commentary: If last year was the year of the New Wave hit, this was the year of the slow '80s ballad. Can't say I enjoy this year all that much. Once again, some of my favorites are in this year but the whole year itself was weighted-down by a bunch of dated fluff. I think I am now ready for the '90s. Didn't think I'd burn out 6 years into the decade, but that's just the way it is (Hey! A reference to a song from this year!).
year: 1986
numberOnes:
  - title: Say You, Say Me
    artist: Lionel Richie
    notes:
      - Love ballad written also written for the film "White Nights"
      - Okay, this song has one of the most needless bridges I've ever heard; it does not fit the song AT ALL
      - Bah, another slow boring song; this one just drags on for 4 minutes; feels like an eternity
  - title: That's What Friends Are For
    artist: Dionne & Friends
    notes:
      - Cover of a Rod Stewart song to help raise money for AIDS research
      - Meh, slow boring song; I do think that Stevie Wonder's vocal parts are good though
  - title: How Will I Know
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - Very upbeat; I like how the drum machine and synths play off each other
      - Houston's voice is really good here; especially during the chorus
      - Okay, this song does the "key-change-upwards" cliche, but it actually sounds good; it's complimented by a little sax riff, which makes it feel a lot more natural
  - title: Kyrie
    artist: Mr. Mister
    notes:
      - Synth rock song
      - This song's synths really are the driving force here; very well done
      - I do think the cheery chorus is little out of place from the more industrial-sounding verse sections
      - '"Key change upwards" but it''s not actually that bad; not amazing, but not terrible'
  - title: Sara
    artist: Starship
    notes:
      - Synth rock ballad
      - Those synths are so spooky
      - This song actually manages to sound very forboding; kind of unique for a love song
      - Mickey Thomas' voice is good here too; solid work here
      - A decent guitar solo in the middle; fits the song well
  - title: These Dreams
    artist: Heart
    notes:
      - "'70s hard rock band turned massive '80s pop act"
      - It's well done for the most part, but it's a mostly forgettable song
  - title: Rock Me Amadeus
    artist: Falco
    notes:
      - 'Synth-pop song about Mozart; first German language #1 hit'
      - Falco was like the Michael Jackson of Europe; he was HUGE over there
      - This song is so damn silly, but Falco owns the aesthetic so well that it makes it kind of a bad-ass song
      - Very catchy chorus; very singable, and you don't even need to know German to sing it!
  - title: Kiss
    artist: Prince & The Revolution
    notes:
      - Very minimal funk rock song; just a drum machine, vocals, and some guitar here and there
      - That main guitar riff that opens the song is great
      - Prince is singing in this really high-falsetto; I'm kinda mixed on it. Sometime it sounds good, other times it sounds whiny
      - When that little guitar break comes in after the second chorus sends this song into funk heaven
  - title: Addicted to Love
    artist: Robert Palmer
    notes:
      - That snare drum sounds so good; just a solid rhythm-section
      - Oh yeah, that guitar riff is the epitome of bad-ass-ery
      - Palmer's vocal performance is great on this song; he's got an amazing range, and he knows how to use it to serve the song
      - Very catchy chorus!
  - title: West End Girls
    artist: Pet Shop Boys
    notes:
      - Synth-pop song
      - Those synth chords are just ethereal; very well-done and fit the mood of their song so well
      - The little bass synths that are played throughout the whole song are also on point
      - The vocals are funny as hell; this posh British guy is literally rapping over a synth-pop song
      - Man, these guys really know their craft. They went all out on the synths on this track, and it doesn't sound like an assault on the ears. It actually sounds great!
  - title: Greatest Love of All
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - Cover of a song done by George Benson back in 1977
      - It's a slow boring ballad for the most part; but Houston's vocal performance is so phenomenal that it actually manages to make it good
  - title: Live to Tell
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - Ballad written for the film "Fire with Fire"; originally an instrumental, Madonna wrote lyrics for it and it turned into a pop single
      - Wow, this is a pop song? It's so spooky sounding, like it should be part of the soundtrack of "Halloween"
      - I mean, it's okay. Not much happens, and it kind of drags on for 6 minutes
  - title: On My Own
    artist: Patti LaBelle & Michael McDonald
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo love duet
      - McDonald is the much better singer here; they do sound good together for the most part, but he really steals the show on this song
      - Not half-bad; kinda wish it had more to it though
  - title: There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)
    artist: Billy Ocean
    notes:
      - Slow ballad
      - Honestly, Ocean sounds a lot better when doing his more upbeat stuff; Here, he just sounds "ok"
      - It's really just a "meh" song; really nothing that great
  - title: Holding Back the Years
    artist: Simply Red
    notes:
      - Another slow ballad... when will it end?!
      - Actually, this sounds REALLY good; The insturmentation is very jazzy, and singer Mick Hucknall's voice is very good
      - To add to the vocals, It's very restrained, and he only belts out when appropriate
      - Also that chorus is just great
      - The build up to that final high-note on the last lyric is just perfection
  - title: Invisible Touch
    artist: Genesis
    notes:
      - Wow, one of my favorite bands! They went from really avant-garde, conceptual prog rock to the most standard synth-pop rock in just a matter of a decade
      - It's a nice and upbeat song, Phil Collins vocals are solid here
      - Their prog roots are still here, that breakdown in the middle sounds like some kind of proto Nine Inch Nails; I like it
      - Oh no! Genesis! Don't do it! Nooooooo! They did the "key-change-upwards" thing! Ah!!!!!!
  - title: Sledgehammer
    artist: Peter Gabriel
    notes:
      - 'This is some divine intervention shit; Peter Gabriel was the former singer for Genesis, and he gets his own #1 hit a week after his former band got theirs. Ha!'
      - Besides that, can we just appreciate how bad-ass this song is? It's so damn funky! Especially during that chorus
      - If you haven't seen the music video for this song yet, you need to look it up. It's wild!
      - When those pan-flutes come in during the outro... and then the groove gets even more funky... it's just soooo good!
  - title: Glory of Love
    artist: Peter Cetera
    notes:
      - Ballad written for the film "Karate Kid Part II"
      - Did Cetera mix up which movie he was writing a song for? This just feels so out of place for this kind of movie
      - Honestly, it's just boring; Not to take away from Cetera's talent, but this just feels like he phoned this one in
  - title: Papa Don't Preach
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - Song about teen pregnancy
      - I got to give Madonna credit for writing a song about this topic; She got boycotted by the Pope! Even just singing about the topic of teen pregnancy is too much for the prudes at the Vatican! Haha!
      - As for the song itself, it's okay; it's not bad, but it's nothing too special
  - title: Higher Love
    artist: Steve Winwood
    notes:
      - The heavy use of percussion in this song is just fantastic
      - Outstanding use of synths and bass; used at just the right times!
      - Also, fantastic vocals from Winwood; especially during the chorus. It really elevates the song to a "Higher" level
      - The breakdown towards the end of the song is great
  - title: Venus
    artist: Bananarama
    notes:
      - 'Synth-pop cover of the #1 hit song from 1970; originally by "Shocking Blue"'
      - Wow, I'm amazed. It actually manages to sound even better with the '80s sound! It adds a sort of urgency to the song it didn't have before
      - I really like those guitar chords sprinkled throughout the song
      - Overall a solid cover; they knew what they were doing
  - title: Take My Breath Away
    artist: Berlin
    notes:
      - Synth-pop ballad written by Giorgio Moroder for the film "Top Gun"
      - I think the vocals are good, but the synths are so over-the-top that it really dates the song
  - title: Stuck With You
    artist: Huey Lewis & The News
    notes:
      - Pop rock song done in the style of an early '60s rock band
      - It's very faithful to that early rock sound; Very talented in that regard
      - It's a good song, but there's nothing too special about it
  - title: When I Think Of You
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - 'The youngest of the Jackson siblings, she now gets her first #1 hit'
      - Solid bassline and piano chord progression
      - Not a half-bad song; solid performance from Jackson here
  - title: True Colors
    artist: Cyndi Lauper
    notes:
      - A very simple, minimal ballad
      - I really like those dissonant guitar arpeggios; neat to see those in a pop song
      - Lauper's vocal performance is very good here, I just really wish her voice wasn't so nasally
  - title: Amanda
    artist: Boston
    notes:
      - Another '70s hard rock band turned '80s pop rock band
      - Originally recorded in 1981, but took 5 years to be released
      - This song hurts to listen to. That's not saying the song's bad, but there's something about the way it's mixed that it's making my head vibrate
      - It's a pretty solid power ballad; Boston was always a very talented band and each member of the band were masters of their craft
  - title: Human
    artist: The Human League
    notes:
      - Synth-pop ballad
      - Nothing screams "We're not robots at all, we promise!" like a song called "Human" by a band called "The Human League"
      - Now that is one hell of a drum beat; so snappy and raw!
      - This song probably has some of the best synths I've ever heard; so profound and well-mixed. It's like it's piercing your soul
      - Amazing vocal performances; especially during that second verse
      - The way the synths fade the song out is just phenomenal; gives me goosebumps
  - title: You Give Love A Bad Name
    artist: Bon Jovi
    notes:
      - 'Our first Glam Metal #1 hit so far'
      - I really like that main guitar riff during the verses; especially when they hit those pitch harmonics!
      - Very singable chorus; I can imagine a whole stadium of people made out of 96% hairspray products belting this out in unison
      - Not a half-bad guitar solo too!
  - title: The Next Time I Fall
    artist: Peter Cetera & Amy Grant
    notes:
      - Love ballad duet
      - Largely forgettable; nothing special at all about the performances
  - title: The Way It Is
    artist: Bruce Hornsby & The Range
    notes:
      - A very upbeat piano ballad about the 1964 Poverty Act and Civil Rights Act of 1964
      - I really love that drum beat; it's so driving and that snare sounds awesome
      - That piano chord movement during the chorus is so damn good; I get chills hearing it
      - That piano solo in the middle is absolutely angelic; probably the best one I've heard so far
      - It is impossible to put into words how amazing this song is
  - title: Walk Like an Egyptian
    artist: The Bangles
    notes:
      - Upbeat pop-rock song with an Egyptian theme
      - The use of Eastern instrumentation and modes/scales is top-notch; it's probably not super accurate to Egyptian specifically, but it's well done
      - The "Way Ohh Way Ohh Oh Way Ohh Wayyyy Ohhhhh" during the chorus is so singable
      - Awesome guitar solo in the middle as well!
