commentary: Not a half-bad year. There were some duds, but overall a pretty solid showing; That over-bearing production quality is still there for the most part, the songs themselves are getting better in this new modern era of pop music; I really hope the only pathway is up, 'cause I really don't want to have to listen to anymore loud-ass mixes.
year: 2010
numberOnes:
  - position: 1
    title: Tik Tok
    artist: Kesha
    notes:
      - Electro-pop song
      - Sorry folks, I really don't like the drunk white valley-girl aesthetic that Kesha did for most of her career
      - Chorus is pretty solid though; probably the only part of the song that I like
  - position: 2
    title: Imma Be
    artist: The Black Eyed Peas
    notes:
      - Jesus Christ, that will.i.am hook is so obnoxious, but I've heard worse
      - I do like the backing vocals behind Fergie's main vocals
      - Whoa, that key change is pretty good, and the way the song picks up the pace suits the key change well
  - position: 3
    title: Break Your Heart
    artist: Taio Cruz feat. Ludacris
    notes:
      - Another Electro-pop song
      - The self-referencial rap verse that Ludacris opens with the song is really cheesy
      - This sounds like "Square Hammer" by Ghost; I guess a Swedish metal band stole this song? xD
      - Besides the good vocal performace by Cruz, the whole song sounds really generic
  - position: 4
    title: Rude Boy
    artist: Rihanna
    notes:
      - Elecro-R&B song with a hint of Dancehall; really bringing her Caribbean roots to this one
      - Solid chorus; very catchy
      - Wow, this one's pretty sexual; very provocative
      - It's a good song, but I do think the mixing is pretty weak; everything's way too loud
  - position: 5
    title: Nothin' on You
    artist: B.o.B feat. Bruno Mars
    notes:
      - Everyone's favorite flat-earther rapper!
      - The chorus by Mars is okay, kinda basic
      - The verses by B.o.B are pretty good; solid flow and good lyrics
      - 'I never thought I ever hear "Nintendo 64" as a lyric in a #1 hit song! xD'
  - position: 6
    title: OMG
    artist: Usher feat. will.i.am
    notes:
      - Elecro-R&B song; first time we've seen a text message short-hand in a song title so far
      - Those backing "Ohhhhhh" vocals are pretty catchy; it's like I'm at a sporting event
      - The lyrics by Usher are a little cheesy, but I guess you can only do so much with a song premise like this one
      - Wow, if I wasn't watching the music video for the song, I may have missed the will.i.am verse; they sound so similar!
  - position: 7
    title: Not Afraid
    artist: Eminem
    notes:
      - I think this is first time we've seen Eminem soften his sound for a more pop appeal; looks like it worked out for him if he's topping the charts again
      - Solid chorus; Eminem's stacked vocals really make it sound a lot bigger
      - Another case of great lyrics and flow by Eminem; he really is deserving of the praise he gets, he's just a really good rapper
      - Wow, he even mentions his lackluster previous record; it's like he's got the same opinion as me on his song "Crack a Bottle"!
      - The bridge is also pretty good too
  - position: 8
    title: California Gurls
    artist: Katy Perry feat. Snoop Dogg
    notes:
      - Electro-pop song; NOT a cover of The Beach Boys song
      - Very hoppy and bouncy; I love that funk bass line too
      - Great chorus; it's like a way better version of the chorus of "Tik Tok" by Kesha
      - Man, Snoop Dogg will do anything for a paycheck will he? Beside that, his verse isn't half-bad
      - Wow, the "California Love" Tupac reference at the end is pretty cheeky
  - position: 9
    title: Love the Way You Lie
    artist: Eminem feat. Rihanna
    notes:
      - "Wow, this is probably the single-most depressing, masochistic song to hit #1"
      - Great vocal performace by Rihanna on the chorus; very powerful
      - Good performace by Eminem, as usual
      - Eminem, my dude... Who hurt you man?
  - position: 10
    title: Teenage Dream
    artist: Katy Perry
    notes:
      - I love that clean electric-guitar riff that drives the song
      - That's one hell of a chorus; love that vocal cadence
      - The post-chorus is even better!
      - I'm impressed. Katy Perry got a lot better over the course of two years; now she's making some solid pop music
  - position: 11
    title: Just The Way You Are
    artist: Bruno Mars
    notes:
      - Love ballad
      - I really love that drum beat; very funky
      - Great lyrics and good vocal cadence by Mars
      - Very pleasant chorus; well-performed
      - It's great to hear a straight-forward pop song like this one; reminds me of the traditional pop of the early '60s
  - position: 12
    title: Like a G6
    artist: Far East Movement feat. The Cataracs & Dev
    notes:
      - 'First Asian act to reach #1 since "Sukiyaki" by Kyu Sakamoto in 1963'
      - It may be club trash, but it's really good trash
      - These guys don't fuck around; they go all out with the "I'm in the club, let's get wasted!" vibe. The beat, the lyrics, the delivery, it's all very in-your-face; THIS is how you write a hedonistic song!
  - position: 13
    title: We R Who We R
    artist: Kesha
    notes:
      - Practically the same song as "Tik Tok"; just a bit different lyrics and beat
      - The forced stuttered vocals is really cheesy
      - I guess it's a bit better than "Tik Tok"
  - position: 14
    title: What's My Name?
    artist: Rihanna feat. Drake
    notes:
      - Rihanna is your name, silly!
      - "First #1 hit for Canadian rapper Drake"
      - Man, Drake's verse has got a good flow, but the lyrics and the smooth delivery is so tacky
      - The chorus by Rihanna is pretty good; I like the patois she puts on it
  - position: 15
    title: Only Girl (In the World)
    artist: Rihanna
    notes:
      - Oh wow, we got a Eurodance song by Rihanna this time!
      - I really like that chorus; very powerful and catchy
      - Probably just a club song, but it's really good for what it is
  - position: 16
    title: Raise Your Glass
    artist: Pink
    notes:
      - Is that a "Dark Knight" reference with that "Why so serious?" lyric? I guess Pink is The Joker now
      - Meh, I guess it's alright; Her attempts at comedy in a bog-standard pop song kinda fall flat here
  - position: 17
    title: Firework
    artist: Katy Perry
    notes:
      - I guess this is my generation's self-empowerment anthem...
      - I really like how the song builds up to that chorus; very powerful vocal performace by Perry
      - Solid bridge section too!
      - Honestly, It's pretty good; I would've thought a song like this would've had a bunch of bottle-poppin references since that's the only music I remember from 11 years ago, but this one's pretty clean and timeless
