      - Vocals drown out the whole mix; poorly mixed overall
  - title: It's All In The Game
    artist: Tommy Edwards
    notes:
      - Co-written by the former VPOTUS of Calvin Coolidge Administration? WHAT?
      - Standard love song; nothing too special, but background vocals are pretty good and mesmerizing!

      - Twitty's vocals are good and powerful; great singer

    notes:
      - Banjo/Guitar Folk song
      - Has a vocal prelude to the story of Tom Dooley
