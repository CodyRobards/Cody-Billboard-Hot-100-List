commentary: Okay, this year was weird. It was either a silly novelty song or a legendary song; very little feel within the grey area on this one. However Marty Robbins and Ray Charles are Titans compared to the rest; really puts them to shame.
year: 1960
numberOnes:
  - title: El Paso
    artist: Marty Robbins
    notes:
      - Marty Robbins was not only a good singer, but an excellent story-teller
      - The Tex-Mex sound is extremely on-point for this story
      - Amazing vocal performance by everyone involved
      - Absolutely engaging story; it's almost like reading a Louis L'amour novel
  - title: Running Bear
    artist: Johnny Preston
    notes:
      - Story about a Native American
      - The "uga-uga" backing vocals are a little too tacky for this novelty song; no way this would pass today
  - title: Teen Angel
    artist: Mark Dinning
    notes:
      - An extremely mopey song about a HS student dying in an car accident
      - Feels really insincere for such a heavy topic
  - title: Theme from a Summer Place
    artist: Percy Faith
    notes:
      - Theme to romantic film "A Summer Place"
      - Very well composed; instrumentation is on point
      - Strings are a little too piercing on the ears though
  - title: Stuck on You
    artist: Elvis Presley
    notes:
      - Clever song lyrics, I must say
      - Elvis' vocal performance is great; not much else to say
  - title: Cathy's Clown
    artist: The Everly Brothers
    notes:
      - The dual-vocals are very impressive; kind of like a proto-Simon & Garfunkel
      - Drums are great on this one
  - title: Everybody's Somebody's Fool
    artist: Connie Francis
    notes:
      - Francis is a good singer, but a little too piercing for my taste (at least on this one)
      - Overall, a pretty standard song of the era
  - title: Alley Oop
    artist: The Hollywood Argyles
    notes:
      - Song about the Newspaper comic
      - Same tacky novelty of The Chipmunks and wears out quickly
  - title: I'm Sorry
    artist: Brenda Lee
    notes:
      - Amazing vocal performance from Lee; very strong
      - Very pleasant string bits here and there; not overdone at all
  - title: Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini
    artist: Brian Hyland
    notes:
      - Absolutely dumb novelty song, but completely self-aware to the point that it becomes great
  - title: It's Now of Never
    artist: Elvis Presley
    notes:
      - Sounds like Elvis is trying to impersonate a ghost, but even then it still sounds great
      - Sometimes a song is so well written that it makes up for it's flaws
  - title: The Twist
    artist: Chubby Checker
    notes:
      - Finally some damn R&B this year...
      - ...and it's infectiously catchy, how can you not like this song?!
      - Sax solos are not to be rejected
  - title: My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own
    artist: Connie Francis
    notes:
      - The stacked vocal tracks help make her vocals haunting in a way
      - The trumpet is a nice touch in between lines
  - title: Mr. Custer
    artist: Larry Verne
    notes:
      - This is like a dollar-store version of Johnny Horton, telling the story of The Battle of the Little Bighorn
      - Unlike Johnny Horton, the vocal performance here is absolutely obnoxious
      - Even in 1960, your average American was equally capable of picking the weirdest damn thing to send to the top of the charts
      - "I still can't believe this was a #1 hit..."
  - title: Save the Last Dance for Me
    artist: The Drifters
    notes:
      - The Drifters were clearly one of the better R&B groups of the era, and it shows here
      - The triangle driving the rhythm section is a little tacky but not to distracing
      - The Strings in the middle are a great addition
  - title: I Want to Be Wanted
    artist: Brenda Lee
    notes:
      - Amazing vocals by Lee as always
      - The lyrics however make here come off as desperate and clingy
  - title: Georgia on My Mind
    artist: Ray Charles
    notes:
      - A song to stand the test of time; an amazing ambassador for the Peach State
      - Very somber and emotional
      - Ever sadder when you consider that Georgia was the last place Ray saw before he went blind at age 7
  - title: Stay
    artist: Maurice Williams & The Zodiacs
    notes:
      - Somehow it took this long in the year for a doo-wop song to top the charts
      - Honestly, it's probably he best one I've heard so far
      - The "Stay!" stabs from the backing vocals is kinda catchy
  - title: Are You Lonesome Tonight?
    artist: Elvis Presley
    notes:
      - A nice and pleasent song from the King
      - Reminds me the Ink Spots, you can tell they were an influence on Elvis
