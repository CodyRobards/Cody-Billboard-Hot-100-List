commentary: This was a year dominated by hip hop, both good and bad songs. I'm liking this era of "Trap" Rap, it's got this minimalistic feel to it and some solid vocal rhythms. Even if I didn't like it, I'd still much prefer this to the "Crunk" era of 2005/06. That was hard to get through.
year: 2018
numberOnes:
  - position: 1
    title: Perfect
    artist: Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé
    notes:
      - Acoustic pop love song
      - Sheeran's voice is good; not crazy amazing, but still good
      - The chorus is pretty solid; not half-bad
      - Beyoncé is the best part of the song; she really cares that second and final verse
  - position: 2
    title: Havana
    artist: Camila Cabello feat. Young Thug
    notes:
      - Salsa-inspired pop song
      - The salsa piano-riff that drives the song is very catchy
      - Solid vocal performance by Cabello; great voice
      - Young Thug's verse is hiliarious; it's like he doesn't want to wake up his parents next door, and he's also drunk as hell
      - Nice tasteful trumpet solo towards the end
  - position: 3
    title: God's Plan
    artist: Drake
    notes:
      - 'I really like those ethereal synths that drive the song; reminds me of the soundtrack to "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver"'
      - Solid flows by Drake, but he sounds so bored on this one
      - I can't help but laugh at the "Turn the O2 into the O3!" line
  - position: 4
    title: Nice For What
    artist: Drake
    notes:
      - Has a bit of a throwback feel to early '90s rap from New Orleans called "Bounce"
      - That beat is great; makes me want to get up and kick ass
      - Drake really picked up the pace on this one, he's a lot more excited and his flows are on-point
      - I really love that breakdown towards the end; top-notch production quality
  - position: 5
    title: This Is America
    artist: Childish Gambino
    notes:
      - Artsy fartsy trap rap song with some afrobeat intermissions throughout; touches on the topics of police, gun violence, and racism
      - Great intro; very catchy and has some amazing melodic timbre
      - The way the afrobeat sections hard cut into that sinister oscillating bass line is terrifying; it's like the song's saying "you happy right now? You enjoying life right now? We'll now I'm pointing a gun at your head... give me your money or die."
      - Gambino's flows and lyrics are a bit ambiguous and esoteric, but that was probably the whole point
      - The minimalistic beat with the shrill synths in the outro is great composition
  - position: 6
    title: Psycho
    artist: Post Malone feat. Ty Dolla Sign
    notes:
      - Cloud rap song
      - Solid beat; very dreamy and pleasant
      - Malone's flows are decent; a bit forced in the chorus but he sounds good everywhere else
      - Ty Dolla Sign's verse is pretty good; solid performance
  - position: 7
    title: Sad!
    artist: XXXTentacion
    notes:
      - "Damn, just four years ago we had a #1 hit song called \"Happy\", now we're \"Sad!\". Times must have gotten tough in four years!"
      - "Another cloud rap song; This is our most recent posthumous #1 hit, going #1 two weeks after XXXTentacion was murdered at a car dealership"
      - I like the beat; very floaty and hazy
      - Great chorus; catchy and... sad I guess?
  - position: 8
    title: I Like It
    artist: Cardi B, Bad Bunny & J Balvin
    notes:
      - A Latin trap rap song? I guess it was inevitable
      - "Cardi B's performance is almost as identical to hers on \"Kodak Black\": solid flows; annoying voice"
      - Bad Bunny's voice is way to monotone on his verse
      - J Balvin's verse is a bit better, still just "okay" overall
      - A bit better than "Kodak Black", but not by much
  - position: 9
    title: In My Feelings
    artist: Drake
    notes:
      - Another "Bounce" rap song; this one's a bit less energetic
      - This really just sounds like a Bounce version of "God's Plan"
      - The breakdown isn't as nearly exciting as on "Nice For What" an- OH MY GOD they sampled Lil' Wayne's "Lolipop"! My God...
  - position: 10
    title: Girls Like You
    artist: Maroon 5 feat. Cardi B
    notes:
      - "Wow, our first pop song to hit #1 this year... and it's a \"4-chords\" song!"
      - The acoustic guitar intro is kinda neat
      - Meh, the whole song is just boring; it drags on and the chorus is no where near as catchy as Adam Levine think's it is
      - Cardi B's verse is realllllyyyy out of place here
  - position: 11
    title: Thank U, Next
    artist: Ariana Grande
    notes:
      - It's basically a pop version of "To All The Girls I've Loved Before" by Julio Iglesias & Willie Nelson, except it's from the girls perspective
      - I like the dreamy keys that drive the song; they almost have a "Christmas" feel to it
      - Solid vocal performance by Grande on this one; suits the song very well
      - "I never thought I'd ever hear a happy break-up song, let alone one that went to #1"
  - position: 12
    title: Sicko Mode
    artist: Travis Scott
    notes:
      - This one's pretty unique; it's like a "prog" rap song; I know I'm gonna love this one!
      - The intro is great; those soaring horn synths really give the song a huge sound
      - Wow okay, Drake's on this one; I guess he's uncredited. He's does a good job with the intro though
      - Okay, here's the prog part; the whole song changes key to this tight beat with a filthy bassline. I like it!
      - Scott's flows are really good too; this song's impressing me every turn so far
      - Another key change; this time the breakdown flows into another tight beat with some twinkly keys
      - Drake comes back on the last verse; he also does a pretty bang up job on this one too
