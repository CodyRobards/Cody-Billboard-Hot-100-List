commentary: "You know what, let's just forget about how many songs reached #1 in a year from now on; I feel like it's 1958 all over again! Despite only 10 songs reaching #1 this year, I can safely say that this was a good year. Not a single bad or even \"meh\" song. Maybe R. Kelly's song is a little hard to listen to in retrospect, but even then his song is at least above-average in quality which I would consider \"good\"."
year: 1994
numberOnes:
  - title: Hero
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Slow R&B ballad; two in a row!
      - Nice lyrics; it's always cool to see a song with a good message
      - It is a pretty standard ballad, but it is a lot better than most. Carey's vocal performance is top-notch as always and the composition and mixing also very good as well
  - title: All for Love
    artist: Brian Adams / Rod Stewart / Sting
    notes:
      - Soft rock ballad written for the film "The Three Musketeers"
      - I just realized how similar these guy's voices are
      - Despite the similarities between their voices, they manage to stand out from each other with those harmonies
      - It's not half-bad; I actually like it. I guess that's what you get when you take 3 very talented musicians and have them work together on a song
  - title: The Power of Love
    artist: Céline Dion
    notes:
      - Cover of the 1984 Jennifer Rush song
      - Slow love ballad
      - Wow, she's got one hell of a voice; very powerful
      - Usually I would say that this is a standard love ballad, but her voice makes it half-decent. However, I think her voice supercedes that and makes this song great. Probably the best female vocalist I've heard so far!
  - title: The Sign
    artist: Ace of Base
    notes:
      - Europop group from Sweden; This is probably the most '90s sounding song ever written
      - I really like the fuse of Reggae and Europop on this one; it sounds like a solid combo of genres
      - I like how the sections without vocals are eerie and spooky but then it kicks into the major-key happy vocal sections
      - Very catchy chorus
      - It's pretty standard song, but not a second is wasted to ensure that the song is catchy at all times
  - title: Bump n' Grind
    artist: R. Kelly
    notes:
      - Man, this guy has fallen from grace now, hasn't he? However, let's put all that aside and see if his music is good in of itself
      - The funny thing is that this song is trying to be smooth and sexy, but R. Kelly is like screaming into the microphone. I can just picture him putting up his mouth up to woman's ear to whisper something only to scream as loudly as possible
      - I will say his voice is pretty good here; kind of a little over-the-top, but he's got chops
  - title: I Swear
    artist: All-4-One
    notes:
      - Originally performed by Country musician John Michael Montgomery; I actually remember hearing only the country version for so long, I didn't even realize that there was an R&B version
      - Not much to say; it's a faithful cover and is well-performed. However, I still prefer the original
  - title: Stay (I Missed You)
    artist: Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories
    notes:
      - "Wow, first time we've seen a folk song reach #1 in a while; this is one of those anomalies to reach #1 with a weird story"
      - "Originally recorded for the film \"Reality Bites\"; this was the first song to reach #1 of an artist that didn't have a record label. The starring actor of the film, Ethan Hawke, was her neighbor and invited her to record her song for the film"
      - Those ascending guitar arpeggios are just so good; so somber yet uplifting
      - The way the song build up with the instrumentation is great composition; especially with those harmonized backing vocals
      - The whole song has this cautious optimism about it; can't say I've heard any songs with this feel so far
  - title: I'll Make Love To You
    artist: Boyz II Men
    notes:
      - "Another massive hit for Boys II Men; this time 14 consectutive weeks at #1 tying Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\""
      - Their vocal harmonies are on point once again; hard to say anything bad
      - Fantastic composition; especially when that bridge section kicks in
      - They really do knock this one out of the park; I will say that I liked "End Of The Road" better
  - title: On Bended Knee
    artist: Boyz II Men
    notes:
      - First time an artist replaced itself at the top spot since The Beatles in 1964
      - "A much more tamer performance this time around; unlike the massive epic songs they've had reach #1, this one's much more restrained"
      - I really wish I could say something that hasn't already been said; it's just a good song in of itself
  - title: Here Comes the Hotstepper
    artist: Ini Kamoze
    notes:
      - Jamaican dancehall song fused with hip hop
      - Insanely funky; that bassline with the record scratches is top-notch
      - Kamoze's flow and patois fit together so well here; it makes the song so much more catchy
      - That chorus with the "murrrrr-der-ah" backing line is just great
