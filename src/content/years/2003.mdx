commentary: Good year! Much more exciting than last, and the composition is getting better again; it just goes to show you that there really isn't an era for when pop music was "good; a lot of the same proclivities and things we like about these songs is pretty timeless and universal across all generations.
year: 2003
numberOnes:
  - title: Lose Yourself
    artist: Eminem
    notes:
      - Song written for the semi-autobiographical film "8-Mile", starring Eminem
      - I really like that somber piano intro before leading into that filthy guitar riff; amazing composition!
      - M O M ' S _ S P A G H E T T I
      - Fantastic verses from Eminem; sold flow and has some interesting and unique rhythms
      - Great chorus; very singable and epic-sounding
  - title: Bump, Bump, Bump
    artist: B2K feat. P. Diddy
    notes:
      - R&B Singer group song with a hip hop edge
      - I like the classical guitar beat; sounds well done
      - The singers do pretty well here, even P Diddy's verse is solid, but it's not enough to make up for the "meh" quality of the song as a whole
  - title: All I Have
    artist: Jennifer Lopez feat. LL Cool J
    notes:
      - Smooth R&B song; samples "Very Special" by Debra Laws
      - "Insane how LL Cool J had his own Top 10 hit songs in the '80s and '90s, but it wasn't until 2003 when he got his first #1, and it was as a feature!"
      - This one feels kinda like a girl version of "Dilemma" by Nelly; it's definitely different, but it FEELS very similar
      - This is Lopez's best vocal performance so far; solid control and not overdone
      - LL Cool J's verses are also pretty solid too, but the lyrical content leaves me wanting something a bit deeper
  - title: In Da Club
    artist: 50 Cent
    notes:
      - Like how "Fortunate Son" by CCR was the soundtrack to Vietnam War, this was the soundtrack to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq; gangsta rap song
      - The "it's your birthday!" line sounds a little silly, but 50 Cent really pulls it off
      - That beat is so bad-ass; it's like he was going for an "epic" rap song
      - 50 Cent's rap flows are on-point, especially during that chorus
  - title: Get Busy
    artist: Sean Paul
    notes:
      - 'Our first proper Dance-hall song to hit #1'
      - It's like a faster version of "Clint Eastwood" by Gorillaz, but with a jamaican patois
      - Song somehow manages to feel like it's goes by too fast while also feeling like it goes on forever; impressive feat, but not the good kind
  - title: 21 Questions
    artist: 50 Cent feat. Nate Dogg
    notes:
      - The smoother side of 50 Cent; this one's a bit more restrained than "In Da Club"
      - I can't say I like the clean electric guitar beat; it's way too stutter-y and repetitive
      - The "I love you like how a fat kid loves cake" line really wasn't thought through, was it?
      - This one really show how 50 Cent is much better at the "large-and-in-charge" rap style
  - title: This is The Night
    artist: Clay Aiken
    notes:
      - 'Another "American Idol" contestant #1 hit song; mid-tempo pop ballad'
      - Aiken's voice is really good on this one, but just like the Kelly Clarkson song from last year, it's just a real boring song overall
  - title: Crazy In Love
    artist: Beyoncé feat. Jay-Z
    notes:
      - "Former Destiny's Child singer's first #1 hit song; duet with her-then boyfriend"
      - Solid horn section beat during the chorus; great choice of sampling
      - Great chorus hook; also that post-chorus "uh uh oh, uh uh oh..." is very catchy
      - Jay-Z's rap verse is pretty solid also!
      - Honestly, the best Destiny's Child related song so far
  - title: Shake Ya Tailfeather
    artist: Nelly, P. Diddy & Murphy Lee
    notes:
      - Besides the cheesy police sirens, the beat is very solid
      - Nelly verse is really great; he really puts 110% into it
      - Very catchy chorus
      - It's clear that this one was tongue-in-cheek, so I can enjoy more than if it was a silly novelty song
  - title: Baby Boy
    artist: Beyoncé feat. Sean Paul
    notes:
      - This one's got an Eastern/Turkish feel to it; dance-hall R&B song
      - It's like a mash up of "In Da Club", "Get Busy", "Crazy In Love" from earlier in the year; weird how that turned out
      - I think both Beyoncé and Sean Paul's performances are better than their hits from earlier in the year
  - title: Stand Up
    artist: Ludacris feat. Shawnna
    notes:
      - Forget what I've said before... THIS is the most aggressive "in-your-face" hip hop so far!
      - Ludacris really doesn't give a damn, he just goes so hard on this one
      - It's a good song, but it does kind of drags on, I really wish they spiced it up with a bridge or something
  - title: Hey Ya!
    artist: Outkast
    notes:
      - Acoustic guitar driven hip hop song; sung entirely by André 3000
      - I really like the chord progression; it's all major chords which is a little different, considering how you usually have at least 1 minor chord when you do the "4-chords"
      - Very solid verses from André 3000; he really brings it
      - For such an upbeat song, it's got some pretty sad lyrics
      - The mid-section is so much fun to listen to "What's cooler than being cool? ICE COLD! Alrightalrightalright..."
      - The breakdown is also really damn good too; "Shake it like a Polaroid picture!"
