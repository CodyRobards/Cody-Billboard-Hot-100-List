commentary: 'Wow, America really couldn''t make up their mind this year on what they liked. There were 27 #1 hit songs this year! What can I say? Well what I can say is that it was another "meh" year. I like how rock and folk are starting to evolve into something new, but I can feel "disco" quickly approaching. Let''s just hope that whatever disco hits become #1 are actually pretty good.'
year: 1973
numberOnes:
  - title: You're So Vain
    artist: Carly Simon
    notes:
      - An insanely shred-dy bass intro for some reason
      - I like how the verses are in a minor key but the choruses are in a major key
      - It may seem a little out of place, but I like the dissonant guitar solo in the middle
      - I thought I heard Mick Jagger doing backing vocals, so I looked it up. Turns out he did but was uncredited!
  - title: Superstition
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    notes:
      - This is when Stevie Wonder went on his "perfect run" of singles and albums. I look forward to this!
      - It cannot be understated how damn funky that electric organ is... just... wow.
      - Of course there's a perfect horn section!
  - title: Crocodile Rock
    artist: Elton John
    notes:
      - Probably the most popular music artist of the '70s
      - A song reminiscing of the '50s Rock N' Roll era
      - Very catchy, although a little silly, especially the "la la la laaaaa!" section
  - title: Killing Me Softly with His Song
    artist: Roberta Flack
    notes:
      - I'm gonna say something controversial... I really don't like this song O_O
      - It's just way too mopey and tacky for me
      - Either than that, the instrumentation is pretty good
  - title: Love Train
    artist: The O'Jays
    notes:
      - World Peace song
      - Soul Train summed up in one song... honestly that's all I can think about when I head this
      - It's a good song, but nothing too special; overplayed on the radio
  - title: The Night the Lights When Out in Georgia
    artist: Vicki Lawrence
    notes:
      - Song about the execution of an innocent man caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
      - Surprise! It was the NARRATOR who was the culprit! whoooooaaaaa!
      - Honestly, the story isn't all that gripping compared to the other folk-y story-tell-y songs we've heard so far
      - Also kinda boring too, not all that exciting to listen to
  - title: Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree
    artist: Dawn feat. Tony Orlando
    notes:
      - A happy, cheery song about a prison convict getting out hoping his girlfriend still loves him
      - Not just one yellow ribbon, but a HUNDRED! WHAT A HAPPY ENDING!
      - It's a nice little song, but nothing too special
  - title: You Are the Sunshine of My Life
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    notes:
      - Probably one of the most relaxing songs ever, at least in the first half
      - It's almost like a prog rock song with how many instruments and key changes it has; it's like the band "Yes" wrote it!
  - title: Frankenstein
    artist: The Edgar Winter Group
    notes:
      - Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Instrumental
      - 'Holy shit, I can''t believe this was a #1 hit. It''s like America decided "we love heavy metal now all of a sudden!"'
      - That main guitar riff stacked with that bassline is sooooo friggin' heavy!
      - Also, let's appreciated the insane talent of every member; it's like everyone is a virtuoso playing at the top of their craft
      - Insane drum solo and keyboard solo!
      - AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  - title: My Love
    artist: Paul McCartney & Wings
    notes:
      - Looks like Paul finally got a new band to play with him
      - This is just flat out boring; it kind of just drags on for 4 minutes
  - title: '"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)'
    artist: George Harrison
    notes:
      - 'Wow, two different Beatles got a #1 hit next to each other'
      - George really was the better Beatle after they broke up and it shows here
      - I really like the slide guitar-solo in the middle; very distinctly George sounding
      - I like it, but I can't say it's something too special
  - title: Will It Go Round in Circles
    artist: Billy Preston
    notes:
      - 'You know, Preston is considered one of many contenders for the "5th Beatle" so I guess you could say we had 3 former-Beatle #1 hits in a row this year!'
      - A pretty good and upbeat funk song, but it's nothing too special; good piano work though
  - title: Bad, Bad Leroy Brown
    artist: Jim Croce
    notes:
      - A boogy-woogy song about a mean hustler from southside Chicago who gets his ass kicked in a barfight
      - Way too catchy and singable
      - Jim Croce was a talent who was taken from this world way too soon
  - title: The Morning After
    artist: Maureen McGovern
    notes:
      - Song written for the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure; kinda of a weird flex but okay
      - I guess it's okay; it's overly melodramatic for such a simple song
  - title: Touch Me In The Morning
    artist: Diana Ross
    notes:
      - Painfully mediocre; it's performed well enough, but it's just... bleh.
      - Really, that's it.
  - title: Brother Louie
    artist: Stories
    notes:
      - Song about an interracial couple; I imagine people back in 1973 were still not okay with that, so a song like this was warrented
      - Really good guitar and string solos throughout
      - Either than that, it's a good song, but nothing else worth mentioning
  - title: Let's Get It On
    artist: Marvin Gaye
    notes:
      - "This is probably the single most sex-postive song ever written, and it was written in 1973! You'd think this was too risque for the day, but the quality of the song was just too good to not be a #1 hit"
      - That ascending chord progression is something just great; hardly any songs use it
      - It's a damn shame that this song has been used in so many corny comedies during "sexy" scenes. Kinda ruins the legacy of the song
  - title: Delta Dawn
    artist: Helen Reddy
    notes:
      - A country song about... I don't know. I think it's about a middle-aged women who is single and delusional about a suitor she met many years ago who told her she would marry her, but she still thinks he's interested? I have no clue
      - I really like the chorus; it's got a very stong gospel feel to it, especially with those backing vocals
  - title: We're an American Band
    artist: Grand Funk
    notes:
      - A song with a nice fusion of funk and hard rock
      - Real good riff during the verses
      - Also great guitar solo too!
  - title: Half-Breed
    artist: Cher
    notes:
      - Song about a "half-breed" women who's father was white and mother was Native American
      - Man, America must have been going through some tough times regarding interracial relations this year
      - It's an okay song; nothing too exciting
  - title: Angie
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    notes:
      - Acoustic ballad written by Keith Richards
      - It's an okay song by Rolling Stones standards which means is pretty good, but I wish it was better
  - title: Midnight Train to Georgia
    artist: Gladys Knight & The Pips
    notes:
      - A nice little soul/funk song
      - It's a good song, not much else to say; very nice to listen to
  - title: Keep on Truckin'
    artist: Eddie Kendricks
    notes:
      - A very upbeat funk song
      - Those speedy organ chords are top-notch!
      - 'For the first time, a #1 Hit song actually manages to make a xylophone sound bad-ass!'
  - title: Photograph
    artist: Ringo Starr
    notes:
      - 'Finally, Ringo gets a #1 hit!'
      - We even got George Harrison on the 12-string acoustic!
      - Honestly, is just an "okay" song; there's some good instrumentation here and there, but it's just kind of drags on
  - title: Top Of The World
    artist: The Carpenters
    notes:
      - A sort of country-pop song; it's got a steel-guitar and eletric piano
      - It's so cheery, you'd think you were in a land of cotton candy and rainbows
      - It's a good song, maybe just a little too cheery. This is like what you'd play in a horror film to put the viewer on edge
  - title: The Most Beautiful Girl
    artist: Charlie Rich
    notes:
      - Another country song with a steel-guitar! we got a two-fer this month!
      - Rich's has got a pretty good voice
      - Another "okay" song; but it's well-performed
  - title: Time In A Bottle
    artist: Jim Croce
    notes:
      - Another posthumous hit, a few months after Croce died in a plane crash
      - It's got a nice bohemian/gypsy feel to it, I like it
      - Neat lyrics, but far from his best work I think
