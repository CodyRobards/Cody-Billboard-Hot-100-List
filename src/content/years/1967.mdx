commentary: Okay, so now it has evened out for sure. However, even then in this short time period, that '60s rock sound has already evolved into psychedelic rock and proto-metal. I look forward to the upcoming years.

numberOnes:
  - title: I'm a Believer
    artist: The Monkees
    notes:
      - Insanely catchy and upbeat
      - Very singable
      - Written by Neil Diamond; of course it's great!
  - title: Kind of a Drag
    artist: The Buckinghams
    notes:
      - A nice organ in the back of the mix
      - It's like I'm really there (at Buckingham Palace in the '60s)
      - There's even an organ solo!
  - title: Ruby Tuesday
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    notes:
      - A slow song for the Rolling Stones; much more tame compared to their other stuff
      - Kind of reminds me of "Elenor Rigby" by The Beatles; it's got similar instrumentation
      - Kind of wish it was as short as Elenor Rigby though...
  - title: Love Is Here and Now You're Gone
    artist: The Supremes
    notes:
      - I wish I could say something good I haven't already said about The Supremes
      - As well performed and composed this song is, it really does sound the same as all of their other songs
  - title: Penny Lane
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - A nice, simple, whimsical song; fits the story being told
      - An interesting key change in the downward direction when the chorus starts up; not very common in music
      - Too fit the whimsical nature of the song is an honest-to-God trumpet solo!
  - title: Happy Together
    artist: The Turtles
    notes:
      - The vocal cadence is too damn catchy; plus those great backing vocals
      - Love the quiet-loud dynamic between the verses and choruses; almost like a Pixies song!
      - A nice powerful ending!
  - title: Somethin' Stupid
    artist: Nancy Sinatra & Frank Sinatra
    notes:
      - Father-Daughter love song duet; kind of got incest vibes with this one
      - Has a nice Bolero composition; very ethereal sounding
      - I real wish I could enjoy this song more, but it's too damn awkward; I can't help it
  - title: The Happening
    artist: The Supremes
    notes:
      - The minor-key intro is quite gritty for an R&B song
      - I can't it's anything special, but this jovial song shakes up the Supremes formula a bit
  - title: Groovin'
    artist: The Young Rascals
    notes:
      - A nice laid-back song about Groovin'. I mean it was '60s, what can you say?
      - Nice piano-chord progression and a nice subtle harmonica over the mix
  - title: Respect
    artist: Arthra Franklin
    notes:
      - Now this is one hell of a R&B song!
      - Outstanding vocal performance from all around; the back vocals are the best I've heard so far for R&B
      - The "R-E-S-P-E-C-T" part is just great; very iconic
  - title: Windy
    artist: The Association
    notes:
      - The bass, organ, and drums play off each other very well in; feels like one instrument
      - A lot more upbeat and happy than I expected
      - Much better than the last Association song; it's just plain better and more catchy!
  - title: Light My Fire
    artist: The Doors
    notes:
      - That organ tone is just too good
      - The organ jam/solo in the middle with that bass line underneath it addicting to listen to
      - Jim Morrison's voice fits the song very well
      - I imagine this song was too risque for '60s America
  - title: All You Need Is Love
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - The pinnicle of love anthems; if only the world had a bit more love in it!
      - I really like the vunerable vocal performance from John Lennon; fits the theme very well
      - Despite being very somber, it can't help but cheer you up, especially with that horn section!
  - title: Ode to Billie Joe
    artist: Bobbie Gentry
    notes:
      - A nice little, funky, folk song
      - A story about a Mississippi boy jumping of a bridge
      - I feel like this was the song that inspired the Doobie Brothers to write "Black Water"; they are very similar
  - title: The Letter
    artist: The Box Tops
    notes:
      - I kind of like the raspy vocals on this one
      - It's a neat topic for a song; but that's about as much as I can about this song
  - title: To Sir with Love
    artist: Lulu
    notes:
      - Theme for the film of the same name
      - Vocals are well-performed
      - I like the chorus, either than that it's just a standard love song
  - title: Incense and Peppermints
    artist: Strawberry Alarm Clock
    notes:
      - This song could not sound more psychedelic; I friggin' love it!
      - The decending chorus line is just great
      - Hell, there's even a distorted guitar solo!
  - title: Daydream Believer
    artist: The Monkees
    notes:
      - A nice little catchy pop song
      - I like the chorus, the stacked vocals help out a lot
  - title: Hello, Goodbye
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - Even my least favorite Beatles hit is still a banger
      - The lyrics are mindlessly repetitive, but even then it's still catchy
      - The drums sound so good!
      - The stereo mix of this song is so well done; feels like it could have be laid down yesterday
