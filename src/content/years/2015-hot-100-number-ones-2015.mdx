commentary: "Don't let the ranking above fool you. EVERY SINGLE TRACK was a great song this year. I can't believe that I found my favorite year for #1 hits this far into the project! I really can't say one negative thing about any of these songs, they're just great. I mean, not ALL of them are legendary masterpieces or anything, but they all have some really good qualities worth listening to."

  - position: 1
    title: Blank Space
    artist: Taylor Swift
    notes:
      - Very minimal pop song; simple beat with a subtle synth
      - Really love the composition of the song, the way that the verse flows into the chorus, and the way the chorus leads into the post-chorus; very well done
      - Great bridge; gotta love those stacked vocals
      - Just a really well-made pop song; Swift and company really gave it their all on this one
  - position: 2
    title: Uptown Funk
    artist: Mark Ronson feat. Bruno Mars
    notes:
      - Funk throwback song
      - Immaculate instrumentation; the bass, the slinky guitar, the drum kit, the synths, the horns, it's flawless
      - Great chorus; the build-up to it is amazing
      - Funny lyrics; tongue-in-cheek, but fits the song very well
      - The story behind this song is quite interesting; Ronson and Mars were in the studio, and were basically on a mission to make the funkiest song ever, and I think they may have succeeded
  - position: 3
    title: See You Again
    artist: Wiz Khalifa feat. Charlie Puth
    notes:
      - Written for the film "Furious 7" as a tribute to recently passed Fast & Furious actor, Paul Walker
      - Solid piano progession; very somber and yet powerful
      - Puth's vocals on the chorus is pretty solid, and Khalifa's flows are on-point
      - The mixing on this song is so good; very well-balanced and pleasant
  - position: 4
    title: Bad Blood
    artist: Taylor Swift feat. Kendrick Lamar
    notes:
      - "NOT a cover of the #1 hit song by Neil Sedaka"
      - Wow, Lamar's verses are so on-point; he's a great rapper
      - Swift's vocal performance on the pre-chorus, chorus, and bridge are really good as well
      - Another well-mixed song; This is exciting!
  - position: 5
    title: Cheerleader
    artist: Omi feat. Jaehn
    notes:
      - A bit of a reggae pop song; reminds me of Akon a bit
      - I really like the samba-feel of the song; especially with that piano
      - A very tasteful trumpet throughout the song
      - I just realized... this is almost a perfect copy of "You Can Call Me Al" by Paul Simon
  - position: 6
    title: Can't Feel My Face
    artist: The Weeknd
    notes:
      - A dark-synthy R&B song; has an '80s feel to it
      - Wow, fantastic voice on The Weeknd; great pipes
      - The bass-funk of the chorus is top-notch
      - The use of backing vocals towards the end is fantastic
  - position: 7
    title: What Do You Mean?
    artist: Justin Bieber
    notes:
      - Solid piano chord-progression; complements the "tick-tock" rhythm well
      - Whoa, are those steel drums and pan flutes? I like it
      - Bieber's airy vocals aren't half-bad either
  - position: 8
    title: The Hills
    artist: The Weeknd
    notes:
      - "The first proper \"Trap\" Rap song to hit #1; Let's see how this sub-genre can hold up for the rest of the decade"
      - Now that's one hell of a way to start a song with those sharp dark-synth stabs; I like it
      - The simple beat with those somber vocals are a great creative choice
      - Great chorus; very smooth in it's delivery, and yet so rough in timbre
  - position: 9
    title: Hello
    artist: Adele
    notes:
      - "This is a slow piano ballad, but it is NOT a cover or Lionel Richie's #1 hit \"Hello\""
      - This piano chord-progression is probably the single best one I've heard so far for a sad ballad; simple yet effective
      - Fantastic chorus; very powerful and sad
      - Okay, this one's even better than "Someone Like You"; The slower, somber feel of this one really elevates it to another level
