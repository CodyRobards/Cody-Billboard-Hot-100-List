commentary: "One of the best years! I never thought one of my favorite years for #1 hits would have been in the 21st century. This was the year of top-notch production quality. A lot of these songs sound timeless; even the \"meh\" songs sound like they could have been released last year. I'm actually optimistic that future #1 hits will keep up the pace of quality mixes."
year: 2007
numberOnes:
  - title: Irreplaceable
    artist: Beyoncé
    notes:
      - I always thought this song was called "To the left, To the left!" for some reason...
      - I really like the acoustic guitar chord-progression; it really serves the song so well
      - Amazing vocal performance by Beyoncé; there's so much breadth to her voice here and she knocks it out of the park
      - Besides, the "Yaasss Gurrllll... Boss Queen!" energy, it's a fantastic song
  - title: Say It Right
    artist: Nelly Furtado
    notes:
      - This is probably the first "Indie" pop song; it's got this stripped down feel to it
      - I really like the reverberated vocals on this one, really makes the song sounds much bigger than it is
      - Great chorus; very powerful sounding
      - I like how the faint electric guitar fades out the song at the end
  - title: What Goes Around... Comes Around
    artist: Justin Timberlake
    notes:
      - Wow, a modern pop song using the bağlama; interesting choice for an intro
      - The minor-key chord progression is pretty neat; never thought I'd see Justin Timberlake doing this
      - Solid chorus; great stacked vocals
      - Timberlake's voice is on-point on this one
  - title: This Is Why I'm Hot
    artist: Mims
    notes:
      - Another "Snap" song; I guess Crunk has finally evolved past it's origins
      - Samples a plethora of other rap songs based on region; lyrics reference where Mim's is "hot"
      - Typical bragadocious rap lyrics; they are done good enough, but they could have been better
      - Honestly, this minimalist style of rap is not half-bad; it's like a proto-trap rap of sorts
  - title: Glamorous
    artist: Fergie feat. Ludacris
    notes:
      - The whole song is just kinda... boring. It's another one of those "puts-me-to-sleep" songs
      - The lyrics just reek of "first world problems"; oh man, it's so hard being a rich pop star! so relatable, am I right?!
      - I guess Ludacris does an alright job on his verse
  - title: Don't Matter
    artist: Akon
    notes:
      - '"4 Chords" Reggae/R&B song'
      - Akon's voice is good on this one. I mean, he's no Marvin Gaye, but it suits the song well
      - Catchy chorus; especially when the song picks up the pace towards the end
  - title: Give It to Me
    artist: Timbaland feat. Nelly Furtado & Justin Timberlake
    notes:
      - It's like the three biggest acts at the time came together to make a song together
      - The spooky sounding synths that hid under the beat are kinda neat
      - Solid flows by all involved on this one
      - Great chorus; "giveittomegiveittomegiveittome"!
  - title: Girlfriend
    artist: Avril Lavigne
    notes:
      - Teeny-bopper pop punk; I actually remember when the music video for this song came out. I was on YouTube when all of a sudden this blew up and got over a million views in like a day which was insane for 2007-era YouTube
      - I can just imagine it; Lavigne going "Hi! I'm Avril Lavigne, and your watching Disney Channel!" with this playing in the background
      - I guess it's catchy and well-composed, but it just comes off as an even tacker version of "Mickey" by Toni Basil
  - title: Makes Me Wonder
    artist: Maroon 5
    notes:
      - "Pop rock dance number; I guess it's worth noting that this is Adam Levine's first #1 hit technically"
      - Lavine's voice is pretty good here; I can't help but think he's trying to imitate Marvin Gaye, but hey, I can't blame him
      - This is probably the most well-crafted song I've heard that I just think is "meh"; I feel like I should like it more, but there's just something about this song that makes it not work for me...
  - title: "\"Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')"
    artist: T-Pain feat. Yung Joc
    notes:
      - Snap song; literally has "Snap" in the sub-title
      - I have to say it; I actually like the autotune on T-Pain's voice. It's clearly part of the aesthetic; it you listen to his voice without it, it turns out that he's actually pretty solid singer
      - The song's compsition is alright; not quite upbeat, not quite a slow ballad
      - Yung Joc's verse is really not that great; he just sounds bored to be there
      - By the way, T-Pain is now a Twitch Streamer, and he's pretty cool you should check him out
  - title: Umbrella
    artist: Rihanna feat. Jay-Z
    notes:
      - Solid drum beat and Jay-Z's opening verse is on-point
      - The chorus is alright; I can't say I like the "umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh," line that much
      - I do like the bridge section; Rihanna's voice is pretty good on it
  - title: Hey There Delilah
    artist: Plain White T's
    notes:
      - Emo band doing an acoustic folk ballad
      - Wow, it's actually just a straight-up acoustic guitar song with vocals. There are some light strings, but either than that it's a very simple song
      - Solid lyrics; a simple song with simple lyrics straight to the point
      - I just realized... this is the '00s version of "Yesterday" by The Beatles; eerily similar
  - title: Beautiful Girls
    artist: Sean Kingston
    notes:
      - A doo-wop song with a '00s R&B production and a hint of reggae
      - Honestly, I like this better than the actual doo-wop that it's imitating
      - I really can't hate on this song too much; it sets out what it wants to do and does it well
  - title: Big Girls Don't Cry (Personal)
    artist: Fergie
    notes:
      - NOT a cover of the Four Seasons song... thank God
      - Pop ballad; acoustic-guitar driven verses
      - Solid vocal work from Fergie on this one; especially during that chorus
      - Fantastic bridge section; well-composed
  - title: Crank That (Soulja Boy)
    artist: Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
    notes:
      - Yoooouuuuuuuuuu!
      - 'Snap song; Our first instructional dance #1 hit since the "Macarena"'
      - Jesus, please don't take me back to 8th grade...
      - Mindless song with mindless lyrics that drags on for way too long... but I gotta admit that minimal steel-drum beat is pretty dope
  - title: Stronger
    artist: Kanye West
    notes:
      - Rap song; samples "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" by Daft Punk
      - Okay, this is probably one of the best uses of a sample I've heard in a rap song; it fits sooo well here
      - That beat is so badass; and West's performance is commanding
      - Great use of stop-go/on-off on this one; can't believe it took this long for a song to pull this off
  - title: Kiss Kiss
    artist: Chris Brown feat. T-Pain
    notes:
      - The radio station call-in intro is pretty funny
      - This is probably the most commanding a crunkish song can sound; I gotta commend them for pulling it off
      - Case in point, T-Pain's feature is really on-point
      - I hate to admit that I like a Chris Brown song now... I mean, it's not amazing, but this is probably the best he's ever looked in his entire life (which isn't saying much if you think about it)
  - title: No One
    artist: Alicia Keys
    notes:
      - Jazzy R&B song
      - I hate to say this, but this feels like a poor-man's "Irreplaceable"; everything that song does, this one does just slightly worse
      - Keys' vocal performance is great, but I can't help but think that they should recorded it the next day instead. She's got this horse voice that sounds like the result of recording a whole bunch of songs earlier in the day. I think it would have been better if she just drank some water and got a good night's rest
