commentary: "Man, I kinda wish I didn't make the cut-off for my megalist at 2020. There were some great #1 hits this year! There were some duds though; I guess that's par for the course. This will almost certainly be my last year I rank #1 hits, so I guess I'll just leave you al with this: There really isn't any years in the past where we had \"good\" music. Maybe what reaches #1 in a given year isn't all that great, but that doesn't mean that the music from that year as a whole was bad. I mean, we just finished up with 2021, and even I think this was a good year and I mostly listen to rock from the 20th century. So for any of you who have been following this project who don't really keep up with today's music, I implore you to check out some of the stuff I've been posting about. You might find some great new stuff that you've been missing out on!"
year: 2021
numberOnes:
  - title: All I Want for Christmas Is You
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - "This song will probably be #1 every December and early January from here 'til eternity. I guess Mariah Carey will never not have a steady source of income; good for her"
  - title: Mood
    artist: 24kGoldn feat. Iann Dior
    notes:
      - Electric-guitar driven rap song
      - Very catchy beat and great flows by 24kGoldn and Dior
  - title: Drivers License
    artist: Olivia Rodrigo
    notes:
      - Dreamy power ballad; breakup song centered around Olivia getting her driver licence and driving around alone
      - It's like Olivia is the teen version of Adele, she's even got a good voice for the most part
      - I like the breakdown in the second half, nice change up to the song
  - title: What's Next
    artist: Drake
    notes:
      - Solid beat, I love that repeating two-note synth riff with that low bass rumble
      - Not half-bad flows by Drake; the lyrics are okay
      - Much better than most of his previous work, but it's no "Nice For What"
  - title: Up
    artist: Cardi B
    notes:
      - Gritty "bad bitch" rap song
      - Oh wow, a Rolands drum machine in the beat; that's a nice throwback!
      - The chorus is little too repetitive; there are words that rhythm with "Up", Cardi. You don't gotta say it over and over again
      - This feels like a sequel to "WAP", both in style and sound, but doesn't hit nearly as hard
  - title: Peaches
    artist: Justin Bieber feat. Daniel Caesar & Giveon
    notes:
      - Low tempo, funk-pop song
      - I guess Bieber is a rapper now, huh
      - The main hook is a little cheesy
      - Both Daniel Caesar and Giveon's voices are amazing; Nice and smooth. Honestly this should be their song solely. Bieber is really out of place here
      - I like the synthy outro; kinda feels like a Daft Punk song
  - title: Montero (Call Me by Your Name)
    artist: Lil' Nas X
    notes:
      - Ah, yes... I remember this. The kid-friendly, cowboy rapper dude who did "Old Town Road" came out as gay, and the whole world lost their damn mind. Then he makes this gay amthem to troll everyone. Let's see if the song holds up on it's own
      - It's like a fusion of flamenco and trap; has a nice beat
      - Thematically biblical; elluding to original sin and the like
      - Meh, it's an okay song; music video is hilarious though
  - title: Leave the Door Open
    artist: Silk Sonic (Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak)
    notes:
      - Bruno Mars has made an '80s and '90s throwback already, it makes sense that he'd make a '70s one. This one's a Philidelphia Soul song.
      - Both Mars' and .Paak's voice are perfect for this song; great performances
      - Insanely smooth and well-constructed; each verse, chorus, and the bridge blends together very well
      - It's a really good song, but I think this is the lesser throwback hit by Mars, compared to "Uptown Funk" and "That's What I Like"
  - title: Rapstar
    artist: Polo G
    notes:
      - Cloud rap song; utilizes an arpeggiated ukulele riff as the base
      - It's not half-bad, but it's really indistinguishable from a lot of other cloud rap.
  - title: Save Your Tears
    artist: The Weeknd & Ariana Grande
    notes:
      - "The synthwave R&B singer is back with another #1 hit song"
      - The main hook is a little dull, at least compared to The Weeknd's previous hits from this album
      - Grande's ad-libed backing vocals are pleasant and subtle; I like it
      - Grande's verses are solid, but nothing too special
      - 'Wow, two #1 hit songs this year with "Daft Punky" outros? Nice!'
  - title: Good 4 U
    artist: Olivia Rodrigo
    notes:
      - Wow, I really like that gritty bassline during the verses. Kinda reminds me of "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails for some reason
      - Meh, the chorus sounds like every pop punk song ever written; at least it's upbeat and catchy
      - The bridge is great; I love that build-up to the chorus
      - Actually, I just realized... this is basically what Avril Lavigne tried to do years ago but failed. This is like a better version of "Girlfriend" but by several magnitudes
  - title: Butter
    artist: BTS
    notes:
      - "The most popular K-pop boy band with another English-sung #1 hit"
      - Solid groove; love that bassline
      - Man, I can't say I dislike the current trend of fusing synthwave into every song... it's a good genre!
      - The rap verses actually aren't half-bad; a little tacky considering the group, but executed well enough
  - title: Permission to Dance
    artist: BTS
    notes:
      - "Another English-sung #1 hit by BTS; Written by Ed Sheeran and others"
      - Has a nice '70s funk fusion groove; I like it
      - Very catchy and upbeat, however it's a little to bubblegummy for my taste
  - title: Stay
    artist: The Kid Laroi & Justin Bieber
    notes:
      - Upbeat cloud rap song
      - Wow, this main riff sounds like Star Fox on the Super Nintendo
      - The chorus is nice; it sounds like something The Weeknd would do
      - Bieber's verse and even his voice is really indistinguishable from The Kid Laroi's, kinda wish he took a different approach with this one
      - Short and sweet; if it wasn't for The Kid Laroi's voice, I really would have confused this song with The Weeknd
  - title: Way 2 Sexy
    artist: Drake feat. Future & Young Thug
    notes:
      - "Rap song; interpolates Right Said Fred's 1991 #1 hit \"I'm Too Sexy\""
      - Laughably comedic; they tried real hard to make the goofy, tongue-in-cheek original hit by Right Said Fred sound badass, but they failed
      - Future sounds like he's about to pass out; I guess that's his appeal, but I'm ust not feeling it
      - Young Thug somehow manages to have the better verse, despite sounding like a 12 year old kid
  - title: My Universe
    artist: Coldplay & BTS
    notes:
      - Never thought I'd see Coldplay on the top of the charts again, but I suspect it's BTS and their fans that put this song up there
      - Has a bit of an electro funk feel to it
      - BTS is actually singing in Korean on this one, with Coldplay doing the English parts
      - Meh, the rap verse is a little out of place here for the style of song
      - "2021: The year everyone tried to write a Daft Punk outro..."
  - title: Industry Baby
    artist: Lil' Nas X feat. Jack Harlow
    notes:
      - Solid flows by both Lil' Nas X and Jack Harlow; I feel like at this point, Lil' Nas X is owning his meme personality and honestly, it works for him
      - Funny lyrics; much better than Montero, I think
  - title: Easy On Me
    artist: Adele
    notes:
      - Adele is back after 6 years; is she still making great hits?
      - Yup. No surprise here. She's still got it
      - Another great piano ballad; I'd rank it somewhere between "Someone Like You" and "Rolling In The Deep"
  - title: "\"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)"
    artist: Taylor Swift
    notes:
      - A Re-recording of an old song from 2012 of hers due to some legal disputes; let's see if after all these years, she can make her old hits better
      - "It took nearly 50 years, but we finally got a #1 hit that's longer than \"American Pie\"; this one clocks in at 10 minutes 13 seconds!"
      - Okay, the "Fuck the patriarchy" line is just too hiliarious for a song like this one
      - She's got an amazing voice on this one; Great range and control, and very reminiscent of her old country singer days
      - The way the song builds up and breaks down is just great; I'd never thought I'd here a pop song keep my attention for this long
