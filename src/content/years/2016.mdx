commentary: "Well, I guess after 2015, the best year in #1 hits, we had only one direction to go (down, of course). However, it didn't need to go down into \"meh\"; too many half-assed dancehall songs, and some poor production jobs really brought this year down. Well, I guess I really can't complain all that much since we are in the home stretch, so let's finish this."
year: 2016
numberOnes:
  - title: Hello
    artist: Adele
    notes:
      - "This is a slow piano ballad, but it is NOT a cover or Lionel Richie's #1 hit \"Hello\""
      - This piano chord-progression is probably the single best one I've heard so far for a sad ballad; simple yet effective
      - Fantastic chorus; very powerful and sad
      - Okay, this one's even better than "Someone Like You"; The slower, somber feel of this one really elevates it to another level
  - title: Sorry
    artist: Justin Bieber
    notes:
      - A sort of dancehall song with a '90s synth pop feel
      - I'm liking the use of those electric trumpet samples
      - The triplet rhythm of Bieber's vocals is pretty neat
      - The build-up to that thunderous chorus is also pretty good
  - title: Love Yourself
    artist: Justin Bieber
    notes:
      - Simple pop song; just Bieber's vocals and a clean electric guitar
      - I like that chorus; the backing vocals behind the main line is top-notch
      - "\"You should go and LOVE yourself\"; I'm pretty sure Bieber is meaning to use a harsher word here"
      - A nice tastful trumpet solo in the middle; I like it
      - I like how the backing vocals change a bit on that last line; great composition
  - title: Pillowtalk
    artist: Zayn
    notes:
      - "This is the first #1 hit by a former member of \"One Direction\", a boy band from the UK that hit it big in the early '10s"
      - A bit of an industrial-sounding R&B song; lots of harsh percussion sounds with low bass notes and synths
      - I'm sorry, I can barely understand what Zayn is saying here; I guess the song's about sex? I have no clue. I think maybe his singing style just doesn't fit here
  - title: Work
    artist: Rihanna feat. Drake
    notes:
      - Okay, it took the caribbean-born Rihanna a while, but she finally a proper dancehall song this time!
      - The tropical beat is pretty neat; the way it continues to accend makes it feel like the kind of thing to bring your spirits up
      - The "work, work, work, work, work, work" patois by Rihanna during the chorus is pretty solid, but probably could of used some more lyrics
      - Drake's verse is decent, but I think the lyrics could've used some work
  - title: Panda
    artist: Desiigner
    notes:
      - "Our first \"indie\" trap rap song; Panda literally just took a free beat he took off of Youtube and rapped over it. That's all it took to hit #1 in 2016! I honestly think that's amazing."
      - Okay, maybe they could have edited out the "free-beats.com" intro in the offical single.
      - I'm a sucker for those "brrrrrrrraps" and "gat gat gats!" I can't help but get into a rap song with a hype man that hyped.
      - Panda's flow is pretty damn good, but I can't understand a word this guys saying. I mean, he's not English ASL; dude grew up in Brooklyn.
      - A little too repetitive, too much hype-man, could be shorter overall
  - title: One Dance
    artist: Drake feat. Wizkid & Kyla
    notes:
      - Wow, another dancehall song; Uses more 808s and less steel drums
      - It's a got nice bit of sampling throughout, but Drake's performance is just really boring on this one
  - title: Can't Stop the Feeling!
    artist: Justin Timberlake
    notes:
      - Upbeat funk-pop song; written for the film "Trolls"
      - Solid funk foundation on this one; good composition
      - Timberlake's vocals are on-point here
      - The chorus is great, but a little over-produced for my liking
  - title: Cheap Thrills
    artist: Sia feat. Sean Paul
    notes:
      - Okay, I guess we're going all out with dancehall this year. We even got Sean Paul to help out too!
      - Damnit, we we're so close to having 2 straight years of well-produced tracks. This one sounds like garbage. The chorus is so muddled and there's like a baby crying in the background just to put the final nail in the coffin
      - I guess Sean Paul's verse is okay; he's doing what he's best at
  - title: Closer
    artist: The Chainsmokers feat. Halsey
    notes:
      - "Our first huge #1 hit song in quite a while; this one ran 12 consectutive weeks at #1"
      - To my disappointment, it is NOT a cover of the Nine Inch Nails song; instead we got an electronic dance song
      - I like the piano foundation of the song; The synth stabs that make up the song are also pretty good
      - The lyrical cadence leading up to the chorus is good, but I can't say the same for the lyrics
      - Can't say I like the chorus bass drop; sounds like it was made on a Fisher-Price instrument
      - Halsey's voice is pretty solid on this one; definitely better than whatever The Chainsmokers are doing
  - title: Black Beatles
    artist: Rae Sremmurd feat. Gucci Mane
    notes:
      - Trap rap song
      - It's got a decent beat; mezmerizing
      - I really can't say the Beatles comparisons are that great; I don't think these guys know much about them
      - Mane's verse is just funny as hell to listen to; it's like he has no care in the world
      - Well, I guess they've at least heard "Daytripper" at least once, since they borrow a lyric from that song
