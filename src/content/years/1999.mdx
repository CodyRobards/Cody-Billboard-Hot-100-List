commentary: "Not a half-bad year, honestly. It could have been stronger, but there were some good one's this year. Well, that's the '90s and the entire 20th century of #1 hits. In just another 20 years, and we'll be up to our current year! I'm optimistic to see what the 21st century has to offer. It's around this time that I can start to recollect memories of what was on the radio and TV. I never really got into \"my generation's\" music; I was too busy listening to The Beatles, Johnny Cash, David Bowie, and Metallica to care about what was going on, so a lot of this will be probably be new to me, unless I recognize it from a school function I was at in 5th grade or from an obscure TV commercial. I guess now, I'll start getting \"nostalgic\" of the music I never really bother to listen to but nevertheless remember from my early youth. Let's go!"
year: 1999
numberOnes:
  - title: I'm Your Angel
    artist: R. Kelly & Céline Dion
    notes:
      - Interesting duet; never thought I'd see Dion sing an R. Kelly song
      - Not all that great; I guess the vocal performances are good, but the song as a whole is boring
  - title: Have You Ever?
    artist: Brandy
    notes:
      - Starts off strong with some angelic vocal harmonies
      - Great production; very smooth-sounding and easy to listen to
      - Just a solid slow R&B song overall
  - title: ...Baby One More Time
    artist: Britney Spears
    notes:
      - Teeny bopper song; Probably the single most "1999" sounding song ever
      - Has a nice groove to it; can't say that I like her voice here all that much
      - It's not a half-bad song; but it's really nothing too speical
  - title: Angel of Mine
    artist: Monica
    notes:
      - Acoustic guitar driven slow R&B song
      - I actually think the guitar matches the hip hop beat pretty well
      - I really like that chorus; especially the "angel of mine" line
  - title: Believe
    artist: Cher
    notes:
      - "It's been a while since Cher had a #1 hit, I think the last one was \"Dark Lady\" in 1974, making this the widest gap between #1 hits for an artist so far"
      - "This is also the oldest solo female to hit #1, Cher being 52-years-old at the time"
      - Suprisingly, it's a dance-pop song with heavy use of autotune; I think this is one of first times it was used in pop music
      - Cher's still got her voice after all these years; impressive
      - It's very upbeat and I actually think the autotune is nice production choice, but I can't imagine listening to this outside of a dance club
  - title: No Scrubs
    artist: TLC
    notes:
      - Absolutely hilarious lyrics; these chicks really don't like scrubs, do they?
      - Solid beat; a real head bopper
      - Pleasant guitar chords throughout; really like those jazz chords!
      - Great chorus; really hammers the point home
      - I will say, if this song was released in our post-2008 recession world, TLC would have a hard time being taken seriously. Good luck trying to find a guy who DOESN'T still live at home with their parents. Housing is fuckin' expensive these days! Maybe in 1999, every one was still living in that "post-cold war afterglow", but, oh boy, how just a few years can change everything...
  - title: Livin' la Vida Loca
    artist: Ricky Martin
    notes:
      - Upbeat latin pop song
      - I really can't say I like Martin's voice during the verses; it's just so plain and unenthusiastic
      - It's nice to see an upbeat song this year, but the whole latin sound here really just comes off as a tacky novelty
  - title: If You Had My Love
    artist: Jennifer Lopez
    notes:
      - Nice use of harpsichord and strings on this one
      - The chorus is nice to listen to
      - Either than that, it's a pretty stock-sounding pop song
  - title: Bills, Bills, Bills
    artist: Destiny's Child
    notes:
      - "Wow, two #1 hit songs in a row that have a harpsichord? Amazing!"
      - The song has this snappy, jerky feel to it; I actually like it
      - The vocal cadence of the vocalists are really on-point here
      - A unique song that has a feel I haven't seen so far
  - title: Wild Wild West
    artist: Will Smith feat. Dru Hill & Kool Moe Dee
    notes:
      - 'Written for the Will Smith film of the same name; samples former #1 hit song "I Wish" by Stevie Wonder'
      - Was award a Raspberry Award for "Worst Original Song" for a film
      - Whether or not I like this song or not, it's knocked up several pegs for simply sampling one of my favorite Stevie Wonder songs
      - I'm gonna go against popular opinion is saying that Will Smith's clean rap is good, actually; This guy really knows how to write a clean song that's still true to the edge of hip hop
  - title: Genie In a Bottle
    artist: Christina Aguilera
    notes:
      - Another teeny bopper song this year
      - This one's a lot better than Spear's song I think; much more solid
      - Has an ethereal quality to it, which is suprising for the kind of sing it is
      - One negative I think is the kick drum; it's a little too loud and is way to erratic
  - title: Baliamos
    artist: Enrique Iglesias
    notes:
      - Another latin pop song; However I think this one feels a lot more authentic compared to Ricky Martin's "Livin' la Vida Loca"
      - I really like that chorus; very powerful and catchy
      - Solid flamenco guitar in the song; I love it
  - title: Unpretty
    artist: TLC
    notes:
      - Acoustic and electric guitar driven R&B song
      - Has a suprisingly happy chord-progression
      - Great vocal performance from TLC on the chorus
      - It's nice to see TLC trying a "rock" song, but this really just feels like a royalty-free "rock" song used for public television
  - title: Heartbreaker
    artist: Mariah Carey feat. Jay-Z
    notes:
      - Here's Carey pushing further into hip-hop with this one
      - I really don't think Carey and Jay-Z fit together well here. It just feels like a Mariah Carey song with some out-of-place Jay-Z raps over it
      - Even with the "Attack of the Name Game" by Stacy Lattisaw sample accounted for, the production quality on the song sounds like it was released in 1990, not 1999!
      - The Jay-Z rap verse is done well, but is once again out-of-place for a song like this
  - title: Smooth
    artist: Santana feat. Rob Thomas
    notes:
      - "Our final #1 hit of the millennium and the 20th century... and it's another latin pop song! Ahhhhh!"
      - Well, it is a Santana song, and he's one hell of a guitar player, so let's check it out.
      - The lead vocals by Rob Thomas (or Matchbox Twenty fame) aren't half-bad; and neither is Santana's guitar ad-lib throughout the song!
      - That chorus is really good; solid composition
      - Once again, I'd like to point out Santana's face-melting guitar work on this one. It's soooo good!
