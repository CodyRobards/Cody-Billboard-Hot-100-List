commentary: Not a bad year. If anything, I guess the novelty of the '80s sound is starting to wear thin, but it's so good on it's own that it kind of grows on you. I know that there will be some really good songs to come in the next few years as some folks hone the sound even more or even journey into some of the proto-90s stuff. I look forward to it!
year: 1984
numberOnes:
  - title: Say Say Say
    artist: Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - An upbeat post-disco duet by two of the biggest pop stars in the world at the time
      - Funny enough, they really don't sing all that much together. They kind of just take turns with the verses
      - A real killer harmonica solo in the middle; a welcome surprise!
      - Just a solid pop song; not too much to complain about
  - title: Owner of a Lonely Heart
    artist: Yes
    notes:
      - Prog Rock song
      - "WHAT!? Yes had a #1 hit song? One of my favorite bands from the '70s?"
      - I really love that main riff; so meaty
      - The sampling throughout the song is just fantastic; very Prog indeed!
      - That bridge is so damn funky!
      - The guitar solo with the octave pedal is so damn bad-ass
      - I'm sorry, I'm very biased here. I love this band. Yes does sacrifice a lot of their experimental prog sound to fit a more poppy sound, but I think they do it very well here
  - title: Karma Chameleon
    artist: Culture Club
    notes:
      - I really the chorus-effect on the main guitar; sounds good
      - Not a half bad use of the blues harp throughout the song
      - Very catchy chorus; very singable
      - Great song; has a unique sound compared to the other pop hits
  - title: Jump
    artist: Van Halen
    notes:
      - Hard rock band does a quasi-ballad about talking someone off the edge
      - Those synths are so good! sounds very acidic while also jovial at the same time
      - The pre-chorus is great, the way that the guitar and vocals build up to the chorus is fantastic
      - Eddie Van was such a great guitarist, as demonstrated by the solo
      - Let's also not ignore the fantastic synth solo! Amazing sound
  - title: Footloose
    artist: Kenny Loggins
    notes:
      - Country artist turned '80s pop star writes the title track for the film of the same name
      - That rhythm section is so on-point it's not even funny
      - That flanger effect on the guitar is also on point; never would have thought it would so well with the song
      - The whole song is like a cross of synth pop and blues rock and it works so well!
      - It's also damn catchy as well
  - title: Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)
    artist: Phil Collins
    notes:
      - Prog rock drummer turned '80s pop star writes the title track for film of the same name (wait, didn't I just write that?)
      - It's a piano ballad by the way
      - This is another soft-spot song for me. It's really not that different than most of the other slow piano ballads we've heard so far, but there's just something about this song that sends it into the stratosphere; I can't put my finger on it
  - title: Hello
    artist: Lionel Richie
    notes:
      - Another slow ballad by Richie
      - Nice piano movement throughout the song
      - I really like the slow guitar solo in the middle; very pleasant
      - I think it's a bit better than his other ballads, but not by much; the instrumentation is what saves it
  - title: Let's Hear It for the Boy
    artist: Deniece Williams
    notes:
      - Another song from the film Footloose; very upbeat
      - I really like the synths on this one, has a cheery yet punchy quality to it
      - Her voice is much better since we last heard her
      - A love song that actually celebrates someone with common flaws? That makes this song at least a step above most love songs
  - title: Time After Time
    artist: Cyndi Lauper
    notes:
      - A soft rock/new wave song
      - Those synths plus that guitar with the chorus-effect is very good
      - I really like that chorus, the vocals are really good and the guitar is very nice and subtlety behind the mix
      - This is a league above her other songs. I'm sorry, but "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" is just not that good compared to this
  - title: The Reflex
    artist: Duran Duran
    notes:
      - Synth-pop/new wave song
      - I think this a rare example of a song that has so much going on in it that I actually enjoy
      - I just really wish the bass was further up in the mix; it's sooooo good on this song
      - I will admit that the "WhHhHhHyYyYyY" warble thing going on with the vocals is annoying
      - The little breakdown thing in the middle I do like despite having the vocal-thing in it
      - "I think it's funny that Duran Duran is best remembered by their songs that didn't reach #1. It's like their #1 hits were flash-in-the-pan successes that everyone forgot about"
  - title: When Doves Cry
    artist: Prince
    notes:
      - Holy shit, that guitar intro is absolutely amazing. He rips that solo apart in the first few seconds!
      - The intro is just great. The "yeah.... yeah... yeah..." vocal fade into the main synth line is top-notch
      - Surprisingly minimal; There's just the vocals, the drum machine, and the occasional synth. No bass to be found
      - Prince did everything on this song by the way; all the instruments and vocals
      - Amazing outro, those baroque-style synth chords with that powerful vocal send-off is just perfect
  - title: Ghostbusters
    artist: Ray Parker Jr.
    notes:
      - One-hit wonder; theme from the film of the same name
      - I really don't know what to say about this song that hasn't already been said. It's like the perfect theme song for a movie about a ghost-removal service
  - title: What's Love Got to Do with It
    artist: Tina Turner
    notes:
      - 'Oldest person to have a #1 up until this point; Turner aged 44 at the time'
      - The lead up to and the chorus itself are pretty good; very caribbean sounding
      - I will say that the synth harmonica is a little tacky; a product of the decade it came from
      - It's an alright song; not bad, but not amazing
  - title: Missing You
    artist: John Waite
    notes:
      - Power ballad
      - It's not half-bad; but it's really nothing to write home about
  - title: Let's Go Crazy
    artist: Prince & The Revolution
    notes:
      - Song about living life to the fullest; we all gonna die anyway, so let's have some fun!
      - That preacher-intro with those Church chords are such a great idea
      - That drum machine beat is just fantastic
      - I really love that "Oh no, let's go!" refrain, too catchy!
      - Great guitar solo in the middle; fits the song very well
      - Oh yeah, and the outro is also amazing; face-melting guitar solo, bluey breakdown, and that "Take me away!" line at the end is absolutely amazing
  - title: I Just Called To Say I Love You
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    notes:
      - Love ballad
      - The song is very well-composed; Wonder was always great in that regard
      - I will say that I do think the lyrics are kinda cheesy. I guess they are innocent and docile, but there's just something about it that makes it feel dated. If only I was a better critic!
      - No Stevie! Don't! Don't fall for the "key-change-upwards-when-your-out-of-ideas" trap!
      - Oh God! He did it twice! The horror!
  - title: Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)
    artist: Billy Ocean
    notes:
      - Very gritty-sounding for a synth-pop R&B song
      - I really like the vocals on the chorus; the way they stack is just great
      - Can't go without having a killer sax solo!
      - Overall, a pretty good song; solid work on this one
  - title: Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go
    artist: Wham!
    notes:
      - 'First #1 for George Michael'
      - The throwback bubblegum pop feel actually works pretty good; I thought it'd sound bad but it's actually well done
      - Insanely catchy
      - Did he just say "beats-per-minute" as a lyric? Haha!
      - Michael has a pretty good voice throughout; solid work
      - There's even a not-half-bad horn solo in the middle
  - title: Out of Touch
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    notes:
      - I love the gritty drum-machine, bass-line, and synth; they work together sooooo well here
      - Even this late in the game, Hall & Oates still were writing bangers!
      - Amazing chorus; very singable
      - Also great bridge; the way it just hangs for a bit... fantastic
  - title: Like a Virgin
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - 'The first of a truck-load of #1 hits Madonna would have throughout her whole career'
      - ...and it's alright. I kind of like the main synth-line and the chord progression is good, but it's nothing too special
      - I can't say I've ever liked Madonna's voice, but she sounds good enough. It's not like she's warbling all over the place or anything, so I got to give her credit for that XD
