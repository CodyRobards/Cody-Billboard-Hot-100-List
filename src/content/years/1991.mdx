commentary: A much better year! Even the stuff that consider "boring" from this year had a charm to it (with the exception of "One More Try"). There was also an insane amount of variety this time around. I never thought I'd hear a glam metal ballad, a soft rock ballad, a britpop song, and a sophisticated alt rap song in the same year. I can only hope that we keep this variety throughout the decade.
year: 1991
numberOnes:
  - title: Justify My Love
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - Whoa, this sounds kinda like a Massive Attack song
      - That drum machine with those bass notes and synth leads is just top notch production!
      - I would say this a great song, but it suffers from the same flaw of lyrics that "(You're) Having My Baby" by Paul Anka has. You can either make it wholesome like how Loggins & Mesina do with their song "Danny's Song" or even romantic like how Marvin Gaye does on "Let's Get it On", but this comes off as trashy and kinda creepy, honestly
  - title: Love Will Never Do (Without You)
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - Wow, another well-produced single from Jackson!
      - Another case, of "gritty rhythm-section"... that's a good thing by the way
      - It's important to note that this record was produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, the same guys who produced "Human" by the Human League, so you know this is gonna be a good song!
  - title: The First Time
    artist: Surface
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song
      - "Bah, another generic love ballad; it's basically indistinguishable from the mountain of the previous #1 hits that sound like this"
  - title: Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)
    artist: C+C Music Factory feat. Freedom Williams
    notes:
      - "'90s dance track"
      - Those distorted guitar chord samples that make up the main riff are just great; the way that they "stab" was a great idea
      - I like how there's a nice and colorful, and diverse of percussion in the song; really makes the song a lot fuller
      - Oh, and then those guitar "stabs" are given a reverb effect around the mid-point; just great work
      - "There's a lot more I can say about this song, but I'll just leave it at this: it's a very-well made dance song."
  - title: All the Man That I Need
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song
      - This is probably Houston's weakest performance; usually her vocals would lift the unimaginative composition to at-least "decent" but here, but I'm just not feeling it this time
  - title: Someday
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Upbeat Dance-pop song
      - On top of Carey's vocal range, she's also got great vocal control on this one
      - Nice little guitar solo in the middle; unexpected, but a welcome addition
      - Not a half-bad song for sure
  - title: One More Try
    artist: Timmy T
    notes:
      - Wow, this is gotta be one of the lamest productions I've ever heard. It's like the producer picked the cheesiest effects to build the composition and called it a day
      - There is an insane amount of dissonance listening to a white guy sing all smooth to a poorly-made rap beat
      - Oh yeah, and the lyrics are also pretty boring too
  - title: Coming Out of the Dark
    artist: Gloria Estefan
    notes:
      - Slow pop song; kinda has a gospel feel to it
      - There's not much going for this song; but the backing choir does a good job of keeping this song from being too bland
      - Not too bad; I wouldn't mind if it came on the radio or at a big-box store
  - title: I've Been Thinking About You
    artist: Londonbeat
    notes:
      - Eurodance song; made for the clubs of London, England
      - I kinda like the little guitar break in the middle; it's neat to hear that in a dance song
      - I dunno, it's an okay song; the vocal performance sounds real weird
  - title: You're In Love
    artist: Wilson Phillips
    notes:
      - I like the vocal harmonies on this one; especially during the chorus
      - "This one's also fairly indistinguishable from their previous #1 hits, but this one's the better of the bunch"
  - title: Baby, Baby
    artist: Amy Grant
    notes:
      - I will say this song's got a real nice synth lead; but did they really have to go with the electric bells SFX?
      - The synth break in the middle has a nice little funky quality to it; I like it
      - Another "okay" song
  - title: Joyride
    artist: Roxette
    notes:
      - This one feels like a spiritual successor to "The Look" from 1989
      - Great triplet rhythm with the drums and bass
      - Real solid guitar work on this one; very bluesy
      - Great bridge; very upbeat and catchy
  - title: I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)
    artist: Hi-Five
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo R&B song
      - The Roland drum machine just dominates this song soooo hard
      - It's actually pretty well done; the harmonies are good, the performances are good, just an all-round solid love R&B song
  - title: I Don't Wanna Cry
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song with a spanish flamenco feel to it
      - Solid vocal work on the chorus
      - Not too bad, but that that amazing either
  - title: More Than Words
    artist: Extreme
    notes:
      - Acoustic guitar love ballad
      - Solid guitar chord progression
      - Amazing vocal harmonies; not to mention the great vocal range of Gary Cherone
      - I never thought I'd heard a shred solo on an acoustic guitar
      - It's just a great song overall; it's simplicity is it's greatest strength
  - title: Rush Rush
    artist: Paula Abdul
    notes:
      - Slow Pop song; another case of heavy Roland drum machine usage
      - I really like the low bass tuning; really fills the low-end of the mix well
      - Oh wow, a violin solo. Not only that, but it's pretty good!
      - Not a half-bad song overall
  - title: Unbeliveable
    artist: EMF
    notes:
      - An upbeat pop rock/rave song; part of a music movement from Manchester, England call "Madchester"
      - Damn, that's one hell of a bassline!
      - The rap verses are actually not too bad; it actually fits the song pretty well
      - I love that "Ohhhhh, what the fuck?!" sample used through the song. I imagine that a lot of people back then and even today don't even recognize it!
      - Oh yeah, there's even a banger of a guitar solo at the end too!
  - title: (Everything I Do) I Do It for You
    artist: Bryan Adams
    notes:
      - 'Canadian soft rock ballad; featured in the film "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"'
      - Pretty solid piano chord progression; everything is pretty well-crafted
      - The movemments betweens sections are also pretty good
      - This song was a MASSIVE international hit... and I have no clue as to why. This isn't a bad song by any means, but it's far from some legendary song
  - title: The Promise of a New Day
    artist: Paula Abdul
    notes:
      - This one's got a mystic quality to it; I like it
      - It's a solid song in of itself, but it is a little repetitive
  - title: I Adore Mi Amor
    artist: Color Me Badd
    notes:
      - Wow, okay. We are coming out of the gate with the a cappella, aren't we?
      - Besides the fantastic vocal harmonies from all involved, this song is just "okay"; not a whole lot going for this song
  - title: Good Vibrations
    artist: Marky Mark & The Funky Bunch feat. Loleatta Holloway
    notes:
      - Hip-hop song from Mark Wahlberg, the older brother Donnie Wahlberf, one of the members of New Kids on the Block
      - Oh yeah, I guess he's also an insanely successful actor as well
      - "I think the best part of this song is the Holloway sample; either than that, it's an okay song. I do think it's better than \"Ice Ice Baby\" so when it comes to ranking white-guy rapping songs, he's #1 of 2 songs so far"
  - title: Emotions
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - An upbeat R&B song; heavily influence from disco. Kinda sounds like "Best of My Love" by The Emotions
      - This is probably the highest I've ever heard someone sing on a pop record; it's like a tea kettle going off
      - Just a well-made song; not much else to say
  - title: Romantic
    artist: Karyn White
    notes:
      - Another song produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis
      - It would be a better song if there wasn't all this stuff going on in this song; it;s just a very muddled mix with just the vocals standing out
  - title: Cream
    artist: Prince & The New Power Generation
    notes:
      - I really like that solid 4-on-the-floor rhythm and that snare drum has one of the best tones I've ever heard
      - I also really like those little guitar bits throughout the whole song; both the wahguitar and clean guitar
      - A solid chorus; very bluesy and catchy
      - This song is just so... "spunky"... if you know what I mean
  - title: When a Man Loves a Woman
    artist: Michael Bolton
    notes:
      - "Cover of the #1 hit by Percy Sledge from 1966"
      - "It's a faithful cover; nothing much else to say. This might as well have been released a decade or two before, it probably would have still been a #1 hit"
  - title: Set Adrift on Memory Bliss
    artist: P.M. Dawn
    notes:
      - Alternative hip hop song; samples "True" by Spandau Ballet as well as some other older pop songs
      - I REALLY REALLY like this; This reminds me A Tribe Called Quest sooo much. They're from New Jersey so they probably were in the same rap scene as them
      - Those dissonant chiming bells that ring throughout the song are just great
      - "The sampling, the rhythm-section, the rap flow, the backing vocal harmonies; they're perfect. How the hell was this a #1 hit song? I think we have another \"Frankenstein at #1\" moment in the American pysche"
  - title: Black or White
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - Song celebrating interracial relationships/racial harmony
      - Insanely catchy; especially with that guitar riff and Michael's vocal cadence
      - Holy shit, that breakdown in the middle is so damn heavy! and it came out of nowhere!
      - It's insane how after nearly three decades, Michael Jackson managed to change with the times and write really good songs to fit those times
