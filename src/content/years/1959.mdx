numberOnes:
  - title: The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)
    artist: The Chipmunks with David Seville
    notes:
      - People still listen to Christmas music in January?
  - title: Smoke Gets in Your Eyes
    artist: The Platters
    notes:
      - Standard doo-woop love song; very pleasant
      - Good lead vocals, but nothing too special
      - Strong finish
  - title: Stagger Lee
    artist: Lloyd Price
    notes:
      - Nice upbeat R&B song; very catchy
      - Good instrument performances and good vocals from Price.
  - title: Venus
    artist: Frankie Avalon
    notes:
      - Very dreamy, but the vocals have wayyy to much reverb
      - Background vocals are surprisingly haunting during the verses; very nice!
  - title: Come Softly to Me
    artist: The Fleetwoods
    notes:
      - Very Do-woppy vocal song
      - Very intimate performance (considering the title), but they sing as if you were a foot away from them their faces.
  - title: The Happy Organ
    artist: Dave "Baby" Cortez
    notes:
      - 'Electric Organ Instrumental song, probably the first electronic song to reach #1'
      - Organ sounds good, but the guitar solo is very muddy and overly-reverberated; can't tell what's going on, AAAAAAAAA
  - title: Kansas City
    artist: Wilbert Harrison
    notes:
      - Sounds like what you would get if you randomly-generated a '50s Rock song on your computer
      - Vocals are very nasally; not my cup of tea
  - title: The Battle of New Orleans
    artist: Johnny Horton
    notes:
      - Classic folk song!
      - Very creative(and funny) way to give a history lesson and very singable!
  - title: Lonely Boy
    artist: Paul Anka
    notes:
      - Sounds kind of like a proto-Beatles song; maybe Anka was an inspiration to them?
      - The bit after each chorus is kind of neat
  - title: A Big Hunk o' Love
    artist: Elvis Presley
    notes:
      - 'First Elvis song to reach #1 on the Hot 100'
      - If there ever was a '50s rock star who was the best at the game, it was the King!
      - Instrumentation and vocals are leagues above anything else so far
      - Almost sounds like a punk song honestly
  - title: The Three Bells
    artist: The Browns
    notes:
      - Vocal driven song
      - Pauses each verse to slow down and sing a bit; kind of distracting
      - Vocals are a little too plain and boring
  - title: Sleepwalk
    artist: Santo & Johnny
    notes:
      - Slide-Guitar Instrumental
      - Absolutely amazing; perfectly personifies what being in a dream is like
      - Lots of emotion packed into a few instruments
  - title: Mack the Knife
    artist: Bobby Darin
    notes:
      - Traditional Pop/Swing song; in the same vein as the Rat Pack
      - Very well composed and very catchy!
      - Definitely the kind of song to put you in a good mood
  - title: Mr. Blue
    artist: The Fleetwoods
    notes:
      - A little better then the other Fleetwoods song earlier in the year
      - The "Mr. Blue" refrain is quite nice to listen to
  - title: Heartaches by the Number
    artist: Guy Mitchell
    notes:
      - "I may be heavily biased in saying this song is great; it's off of the soundtrack for Fallout: New Vegas, the greatest game of all time"
      - The chorus is quite memorable and each verse builds off the last one quite well
  - title: Why
    artist: Frankie Avalon
    notes:
      - The harp-like guitar chords suite the song very well
      - The female vocals in the last half are kinda of plain
