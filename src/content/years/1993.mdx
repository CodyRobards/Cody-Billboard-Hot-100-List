commentary: Never mind what I said about 1992. THIS was the year people didn't get bored. only 11 songs topped the chart this year. Wow. I will say that this year was a little bit less as enjoyable as last year, but even then this one's another "I dunno" year for me.

numberOnes:
  - title: I Will Always Love You
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - Originally written by Dolly Parton in 1973; this cover was recorded for the film "The Bodyguard"
      - 'Okay, that didn''t take long. This song was at #1 for 14 consecutive weeks, beating out "The End Of the Road" by just 1 week. Does THIS stack up?'
      - ...eh, not really. I know this is going against the grain, but this song's just "meh". It's basically just a standard slow pop ballad, but it does have that insane key-change where she goes "and IIIIIIIIIII" which is quite impressive vocally, but that's really the only memorable part
  - title: A Whole New World
    artist: Peabo Bryson & Regina Belle
    notes:
      - A slow R&B cover of the Disney song from "Aladdin"
      - This was always one of my favorite Disney songs, so I might be biased in saying that "It's good"
      - It's pretty faithful to the original from the film, but I'd still pick the film version sung by the actors over this one
  - title: Informer
    artist: Snow
    notes:
      - A Hip-hop/Reggae crossover hit; sung by a white guy from Canada
      - This guy's got an insane flow; he's like a proto Eminem or Tech n9ne
      - Honestly, I actually like this one. It's just a well-made song through and through; not much else to say
      - You know, it's funny how people wrote this guy off as another Vanilla Ice, but he actually grew up "in the hood" in Toronto and probably did do all the things he said he did. Also one of the reasons why he never took off in the US past this song was because he was barred from entering the country due to an attempted murder charge in Canada, so he couldn't really capitalize on his success all that much
  - title: Freak Me
    artist: Silk
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song
      - The smooth R&B production and the "seductive" lyrical performance DO NOT mix AT ALL
      - Also, these lyrics are so cheesy; another case of trying to sound seductive while actually coming off as creepy
      - It's like listening to a dollar-store knock-off of Boys II Men
  - title: That's The Way Love Goes
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - 'longest #1 hit for the Jackson family; topped the chart for 8 consecutive weeks'
      - Cool, another Trip-Hop sounding song!
      - This time, it's a lot better then Madonna's attempt on "Justify My Love"
      - Overall, this one's not too bad; but it's nothing too special
  - title: Weak
    artist: SWV
    notes:
      - Smooth R&B all-girl vocal group
      - '"Weak" huh? Is that a self-admittance of the song''s quality, SWV?'
      - In all seriousness, it's not bad but it really lacks the character a lot of other vocal groups have
  - title: (I Can't Help) Falling In Love
    artist: UB40
    notes:
      - Dance pop cover of the famous Elvis Presley song from 1961
      - I like this cover. It takes the more intimate original and adds a more upbeat, optimistic quality to it
  - title: Dreamlover
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Upbeat R&B song
      - Such a solid chord progression; the kind that puts you in a good mood
      - I really like that chorus; it's so catchy and well-done
      - Really good vocal harmonies throughout
      - The mixing and production quality is top-notch; it sounds like a song you'd hear in the 21th century
  - title: I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)
    artist: Meat Loaf
    notes:
      - 'Off of his comeback album "Bat Out Of Hell II: Back into Hell"'
      - Okay, THIS has to be the last '80s power ballad. It's already 1993 for crying out loud!
      - Since this is a Meat Loaf song, you can bet your ass it's gonna be a massive rock opera of a song
      - I know it's the chorus that everyone loves, but I think everything else around it is better; especially those fast sections
      - Honestly, I think this is a downgrade to his work on "Bat Out of Hell", less catchy and more melodramatic
  - title: Again
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - Slow R&B piano ballad
      - It's not a bad song by any means, but I do think Janet is better off doing the more upbeat songs instead; leave the ballads to other folks
      - The String arrangement at the end is kinda neat though
  - title: Hero
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Slow R&B ballad; two in a row!
      - Nice lyrics; it's always cool to see a song with a good message
      - It is a pretty standard ballad, but it is a lot better than most. Carey's vocal performance is top-notch as always and the composition and mixing also very good as well
