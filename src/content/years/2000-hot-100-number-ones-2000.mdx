commentary: "Not a strong start for the new millennium. It is cool to see rock making a comeback, but I feel like the better rock songs of this era were the ones that DIDN'T reach #1. Another thing I really don't like is the directiopn R&B is going. The smooth and buttery R&B of the '90s is now morphing into this sort of mid-tempo dance sub-genre and I really don't think it's the right direction. I can only how that the variety of these songs can break the monotany in the coming years."

  - position: 1
    title: Smooth
    artist: Santana feat. Rob Thomas
    notes:
      - "Our final #1 hit of the millennium and the 20th century... and it's another latin pop song! Ahhhhh!"
      - Well, it is a Santana song, and he's one hell of a guitar player, so let's check it out.
      - The lead vocals by Rob Thomas (or Matchbox Twenty fame) aren't half-bad; and neither is Santana's guitar ad-lib throughout the song!
      - That chorus is really good; solid composition
      - Once again, I'd like to point out Santana's face-melting guitar work on this one. It's soooo good!
  - position: 2
    title: What a Girl Wants
    artist: Christina Aguilera
    notes:
      - I kinda like the erratic rhythm of the song
      - Has nice jazzy chorus; very cool
      - It not a half-bad song, but it's not something I'd write home about
  - position: 3
    title: I Knew I Loved You
    artist: Savage Garden
    notes:
      - Slow pop ballad
      - I like the rising arpeggiated guitar chords; very pleasant to listen to
      - Solid performance; however, it's nothing too special of a song
  - position: 4
    title: Thank God I Found You
    artist: Mariah Carey feat. Joe & 98 Degrees
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song
      - "It sounds like a mixed of the last two #1 hits; very weird coincidence"
      - Joe & 98 Degrees' performance is pretty solid
      - Another song that's not half-bad, but nothing too special
  - position: 5
    title: Amazed (AC Mix)
    artist: Lonestar
    notes:
      - Country power ballad
      - It really does just feel like a knock-off of "I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing" by Aerosmith
      - Besides that, it's a fairly decent song; it's done well-enough
  - position: 6
    title: Say My Name
    artist: Destiny's Child
    notes:
      - They have an insane flow on this one; they should be a rap group instead!
      - Besides the good vocal performances, the song really just sounds like a second-rate TLC song
  - position: 7
    title: Maria Maria
    artist: Santana feat. The Product G&B
    notes:
      - It sounds like a fusion of Dr. Dre and Santana; interesting creative choice
      - Very tasty guitar licks throughout
      - The vocals from The Product R&B are pretty solid; still a little out of place for a Santana song
  - position: 8
    title: Try Again
    artist: Aaliyah
    notes:
      - Dance-pop/R&B song
      - Those acid synths don't sound half-bad
      - It kind of drags on a bit, but the song as a whole is pretty solid
  - position: 9
    title: Be With You
    artist: Enrique Iglesias
    notes:
      - Dance-pop song
      - Kind of feels like "Believe" by Cher; however this one's a bit more restrained in it's performance
      - Another good song that I really wouldn't listen to outside of a club setting
  - position: 10
    title: Everything You Want
    artist: Vertical Horizon
    notes:
      - "Our first post-grunge rock song to reach #1; it really took nearly a whole decade for this genre to get to the top, huh?"
      - I really like that fade-in and out pedal effect on the main guitar riff
      - Surprisingly upbeat and happy-sounding concidering the genre it's from
      - Solid bridge section; sounds kinda heavy
      - You know, a lot of people look back at the early '00s rock in digust, but honestly, this sound was probably the closest rock was ever going to get to mainstream pop appeal, and it really isn't half-bad. I like it!
  - position: 11
    title: Bent
    artist: Matchbox Twenty
    notes:
      - Post-grunge rock ballad
      - Honestly, this song just sounds like a shitty '80s rock knock-off; the only thing that's contemporary sounding here is the occational distorted metal guitar bits
      - I guess the guitar solo is kinda neat...
  - position: 12
    title: It's Gonna Be Me
    artist: "'N Sync"
    notes:
      - Boy band pop song; this one's got a real young Justin Timberlake in it!
      - Oh god, I remember how overplayed this band was. Everyone in my Kindergarden and 1st Grade class were OBSESSED with these guys
      - This song is like the boy-band equivalant of "...Baby One More Time" by Britney Spears
      - The "It's gonna be maaayyyyy" is the perfect thing to play on April 31st of every year
  - position: 13
    title: Incomplete
    artist: Sisqó
    notes:
      - Smooth R&B song
      - Bah, largely forgettable song; indistinguishable from most other slow R&B we've heard but even more generic-sounding
  - position: 14
    title: Doesn't Really Matter
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - 'R&B song featured in the film "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps"'
      - Wow... that's an odd choice for a flim for a song like this one
      - Damn, this one sounds like an obnoxious version of a Destiny's Child song; those weird sounds effects throughout the song are really distracting
      - Waayyyyy too long; why is this song 5 minutes long?!
  - position: 15
    title: Music
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - This one's a weird departure for Madonna; it's like an electronic funk song with robo-backing vocals
      - This one's complete garbage; the lyrics are lame, the production quality is so dry and sterile, Madonna's vocal performance is so phoned-in. It's like a parody of what a bad Madonna song would sound like, but instead it's just Madonna doing a bad song
  - position: 16
    title: Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)
    artist: Christina Aguilera
    notes:
      - Solid piano chord progression and beat underneath the song
      - Man, Aguilera really likes those harpsichords, doesn't she?
      - Very upbeat and catchy; especially that chorus
      - "Her best #1 hit so far, I think"
  - position: 17
    title: With Arms Wide Open
    artist: Creed
    notes:
      - "Our third post-grunge rock #1 hit this year"
      - Wow, Scott Stapp's vocal impression of Eddie Veder is so obvious, it's hard to ignore
      - The song drags on for nearly two minutes before the distored guitar come in, kinda wish they did that sooner
      - I kinda like the guitar solo,; for the most part, it fits the song well enough
      - This song could have been so much better, but it lacks the punch a song like this one should have; it's sooo softball here
  - position: 18
    title: Independent Women Pt. 1
    artist: Destiny's Child
    notes:
      - R&B Song featured in the "Charlie's Angels" movie re-boot
      - I like this one, there's a real "attitude" present in their performances, and they are large and in-charge here
      - Great chorus; very catchy and well-done
      - The church choir section is great; good creative decision
