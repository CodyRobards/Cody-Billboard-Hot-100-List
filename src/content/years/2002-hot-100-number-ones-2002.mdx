commentary: "A very \"meh\" year; It's insane how long America kept the most mundane songs at the top of the charts for so long; only 9 #1 hits songs happened this year, with only 7 being new songs! However, they're not terrible, but most of these songs lack the character I crave for. I really do hope next year is better."

    title: How You Remind Me
    artist: Nickelback
    notes:
      - "This was probably the last straight-up rock song to reach #1, and it's no surprise to me that it's a Nickelback song"
      - "My first real clear memory of a song at 6-years-old; I remember how one week, this song didn't exist, and then the next week it was EVERYWHERE. On the radio, on burnt-CDs, at grocery stores, it was insane how this one blew up and according to Neilsen Soundscan, this was the #1 song of the decade in terms radioplay for the '00s decade"
      - Solid guitar driven song; a lot more distortion focused and it's in Drop D tuning!
      - The vocals are decent; can't say I like Chad Kroger's voice, but it fits the style well enough
      - The chorus is good; and I like the quiet middle-section as well
  - position: 2
    title: U Got It Bad
    artist: Usher
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song; acoustic guitar driven
      - I guess someone had to carry the torch of slow R&B after Boyz II Men left the scene; can't say I enjoy this too much but it's well-done for what it's worth
      - Neat guitar solo outro though
  - position: 3
    title: Always on Time
    artist: Ja Rule feat. Ashanti
    notes:
      - R&B/Hip-hop song
      - Besides the solid guitar-driven beat, Ja Rule's performance sounds "fake" aggressive here; sounds like he's trying to be tough
      - Ashanti's performace is good enough, but it's really nothing too speical; it could have been anybody honestly
  - position: 4
    title: Ain't It Funny (Murder Mix)
    artist: Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule
    notes:
      - It's... like... literally the same song as the last one. Well, it's actually extremely similar
      - If anything, both performaces are a bit better here, but overall the song isn't anything too special
  - position: 5
    title: Foolish
    artist: Ashanti
    notes:
      - It feels likes slow R&B song, but sounds like a mid-tempo R&B song; weird how that turned out
      - Honestly, the production is really tacky; I really think the person who composed the beat should have put more work into it
      - Way too repetitive; the 5-second loop of the beat is what does that
  - position: 6
    title: Hot In Herre
    artist: Nelly
    notes:
      - Gotta throw in an extra "r" in "Here", 'cause why not?!
      - Very upbeat R&B song; has a nice driving force behind it
      - Nelly's performance is on-point, he's in-charge on this track
      - The chorus is little silly, but much like "Baby Got Back" by Sir Mix-a-Lot, Nelly's command presence of the song makes up for it
  - position: 7
    title: Dilemma
    artist: Nelly feat. Kelly Rowland
    notes:
      - "Two #1 hits in a rwo for Nelly, good for him"
      - This honestly just feels like a better-produced version of "Tha Crossroads" by Bone Thugs-N-Harmony; I like it
      - Howland's performace on the chorus is good for the most part but like the other songs this year, this feature could have been anybody else and nobody would have noticed
  - position: 8
    title: A Moment Like This
    artist: Kelly Clarkson
    notes:
      - "First #1 hit from an \"American Idol\" contestant; the staple vocal talent show of the '00s decade"
      - Clarkson's voice sounds good on this song, but it's just... so... boring! They really phoned this one in to capitalize on the topicalness of Clarkson, didn't they?
  - position: 9
    title: Lose Yourself
    artist: Eminem
    notes:
      - Song written for the semi-autobiographical film "8-Mile", starring Eminem
      - I really like that somber piano intro before leading into that filthy guitar riff; amazing composition!
      - M O M ' S  S P A G H E T T I
      - Fantastic verses from Eminem; sold flow and has some interesting and unique rhythms
      - Great chorus; very singable and epic-sounding
