commentary_excerpt: Scratch what said about 1973. THIS year America couldn't make up their mind! I will say that this was a better year. Not too bad; a nice bit of variety this time around.

year: 1974
numberOnes:
  - title: Time In A Bottle
    artist: Jim Croce
    notes:
      - Another posthumous hit, a few months after Croce died in a plane crash
      - It's got a nice bohemian/gypsy feel to it, I like it
      - Neat lyrics, but far from his best work I think
  - title: The Joker
    artist: Steve Miller Band
    notes:
      - Nice laid back, acoustic jam
      - The cat-calling wah slide-guitar is so silly
      - I mean the wah slide-guitar is great everywhere else
      - Great chorus; I imagine every campfire hippie guitarist was playing this
  - title: Show and Tell
    artist: Al Wilson
    notes:
      - Nice piano chords and string section
      - I really like the chorus; fits the song very well
      - Overall, a well done song
  - title: "\"You're Sixteen (You're Beautiful And You're Mine)"
    artist: Ringo Starr
    notes:
      - Cover of an old boogy-woogy Rock N' Roll song
      - THIS was what inspired The Beatles, just so you know
      - WTF is that a kazoo solo?
      - I guess it's okay; not terrible
  - title: The Way We Were
    artist: Barbra Streisand
    notes:
      - Slow piano ballad made for the film of the same name
      - Another slow love song made for a romantic drama; this is one hell of a specific genre
      - It's okay; nothing too special
  - title: Love's Theme
    artist: Love Unlimited Orchestra
    notes:
      - "First Barry White #1; instrumental"
      - Lives up to it's name pretty good; sounds like what a love theme would be
      - Great work all around; great string section, great rhythm section, and a nice funky guitar to top it off
  - title: Seasons in the Sun
    artist: Terry Jacks
    notes:
      - It's actually not a anti-Vietnam war song, just a song mourning the loss of a close friend; written in 1961 by a Belgian songwriter
      - I can't say I like the key changes on this one; a little too jarring
      - It's an okay song; a little too melodramatic for me
  - title: Dark Lady
    artist: Cher
    notes:
      - Song about a gypsy fortune-teller in New Orleans
      - The sound fits the gypsy theme; but even then it's a pretty boring song
  - title: Sunshine on My Shoulders
    artist: John Denver
    notes:
      - A nice little, happy acoustic folk song
      - That chord progression is so good; and the little alterations throughout are just great
      - Denver's voice is really good and works well with the arpeggiated guitar chords
  - title: Hooked on a Feeling
    artist: Blue Swede
    notes:
      - Oh god, it's the "OOGA-CHAKA-OOGA-OOGA" song
      - Like I have no clue who thought that was a good idea, it like DOES NOT fit the song AT ALL
      - Either than that, the sections without the singing tiki-torch totems are pretty decent
  - title: Bennie and the Jets
    artist: Elton John
    notes:
      - Contrary to what it sounds like, it's not a live performance. It was added afterwards to make it sound that was
      - I really like that staggard rhythm; it works well with those outstanding piano chords
      - Amazing vocal performace by Elton John; kind of goofy, but well done
      - Those little electric organ bits at the end is just the icing on the cake
  - title: '"TSOP (The Sound of Philidelphia)'
    artist: MFSB & The Three Degrees
    notes:
      - An instrumental song written to be the ambassador of Philidelphia Soul; a sub-genre of soul to come from... well, from Philly.
      - What can I say? It's an amazing song. Top notch performaces from all of the musicians involved and well crafted
      - Well, there are some backing vocals near the end, which are just great!
  - title: The Loco-Motion
    artist: Grand Funk
    notes:
      - "Cover of the Little Eva song that was a #1 back in 1962"
      - Honestly, I like the originally better; this is just a straight cover of the song with worse mixing
      - The distorted guitar solo is really out of place here, and it's not all that great either
  - title: The Streak
    artist: Ray Stevens
    notes:
      - A silly novelty country song about a streaker
      - It sounds like a skit off of Yee-Haw made into a record
      - That friggin slide whistle is just too damn silly
      - "I can't hate this song; it's literally made to sound as silly as possible. Sometimes America can be weird and make some songs get to #1"
  - title: Band On The Run
    artist: Paul McCartney & Wings
    notes:
      - I really like the nice and calm intro before going into the funky minor-key change
      - Is this song prog enough? another key-change by a whole ass brass section into the main progression
      - The main progression is just great; something that sounds like it could have been a Beatles song
      - Those little guitar bits during the chorus are just great; very catchy!
  - title: Billy, Don't Be a Hero
    artist: Bo Donaldson & The Heywoods
    notes:
      - Silly novelty-pop song about a Civil War Union soldier getting killed in action
      - It's just so damn tacky; it could have been a song tackling the tragedy of death in war, but it sounds like a teenager crush song done by the Jackson 5
      - If there is any redeeming factor of this song, it's that the drummer is friggin killing it on the set
  - title: Sundown
    artist: Gordon Lightfoot
    notes:
      - A funky little country song
      - I like the stacked vocals on the chorus; sounds good
      - It's a good song, although it's nothing too special
      - Not so much of a fun fact; the woman this song is about is the same woman who would later inject the 11 consectutive speedballs that killed John Belushi. "Oops! I just accidentally killed him! Silly me!"
  - title: Rock the Boat
    artist: The Hues Corporation
    notes:
      - A nice, little, disco song
      - The chorus is kind of catchy
      - Besides that, it's an okay song; I like the insturmentation at the end with the brass section and guitar
  - title: Rock Your Baby
    artist: George McCrae
    notes:
      - Disco song
      - What's that? Is that a Roland Drum Machine I hear?
      - It's even a clave rhythm! Nice!
      - Besides that, it's an okay song; nothing too special. Kind of drags on
  - title: Annie's Song
    artist: John Denver
    notes:
      - A nice little folk love song
      - I really like the guitar on this one; sounds real nice
      - I can't say I like the build up to the strings and other instruments; kind of overkill
      - The vocals are also a little to forced I think; wish they were more restrained instead
  - title: Feel Like Makin' Love
    artist: Roberta Flack
    notes:
      - Man, the Grammys REALLY loved Roberta Flack. She won Song Of The Year 2 years in a row with "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and "Killing Me Softly with His Song" and almost 3 years with this one!
      - I like this one, it's real calm and laid back. Either than that, it's nothing too special
  - title: The Night Chicago Died
    artist: Paper Lace
    notes:
      - Song about a fictional shootout between Al Capone's gang and the police
      - I don't know, this one's just the most plain boring rock song ever
  - title: (You're) Having My Baby
    artist: Paul Anka & Odia Coates
    notes:
      - I'm sorry, this song just comes off real creepy. I mean it's sincere enough, but the lyrics (and performace) are like an alien wrote them. Especially the "she didn't get the abortion" part
      - Well, I guess someone had to write a love song about pregnancy; kind of wish it wasn't this awkward though
  - title: I Shot The Sheriff
    artist: Eric Clapton
    notes:
      - Cover of the Bob Marley classic
      - "It's pretty good; surprised this was a #1 hit considering the types of music people were listening to at this time"
      - Clapton is such a great guitarist; even when his guitar is hidden in the back of the mix, it's distict enough to stand out
  - title: Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe
    artist: Barry White
    notes:
      - I think Barry White is the only one who can get away with talky parts in songs
      - One of the most distinct Bass-Baratone voices ever
      - That vocal line during the chorus with those drums is just to groovy
  - title: Rock Me Gently
    artist: Andy Kim
    notes:
      - Kim doing his best Neil Diamond impression
      - It sounds okay; but I can't help but think this is a dollar-store Neil Diamond song
      - I will say, that is a tasty electric solo in the middle
  - title: I Honestly Love You
    artist: Olivia Newton-John
    notes:
      - Slow piano ballad
      - If there ever was a contendant for "most generic love song" I think this would be one
      - Maybe I should be too mean; it is well performed and it's not over-bearing or anything like that
  - title: Nothing From Nothing
    artist: Billy Preston
    notes:
      - Preston showing once again that he is king of piano funk
      - Very upbeat and catchy; I like it
  - title: Then Came You
    artist: Dionne Warwick & The Spinners
    notes:
      - It's an okay soul song; there really isn't anything about this song that stands out
  - title: You Haven't Done Nothin'
    artist: Stevie Wonder
    notes:
      - Song about Richard Nixon. Ooh, spicy!
      - Nice double-negative there, Stevie.
      - Sorry, enough ribbing... this song is absolutely amazing!
      - That "Doo Da Wop!" line is just too damn good
      - Everything about this song is just perfect; the vocals, the electric organ, the percussion, the brass section. It's just too good!
  - title: You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet
    artist: Bachman-Turner Overdrive
    notes:
      - Hard rock song
      - Great chord progression leading up to that chorus
      - Great chorus! those distorted guitar chords are awesome!
      - I really like those reverberated almost back-masked sounding guitar leads throughout the song; gives is a fuller sound
  - title: Whatever Gets You Thru the Night
    artist: John Lennon
    notes:
      - "Wow, it really took this long for John to get his first #1 hit song"
      - Okay, there is way too much going on here. It's such a cacophony of sound
      - This sounds NOTHING like something that John would do; I feel like there might be a ghostwriter involved here XD
  - title: I Can Help
    artist: Billy Swan
    notes:
      - A nice little rockabilly song
      - Very cheery and nice to listen to
      - I really like that guitar bit after the bridge and during the outro
      - I like the silly double false ending!
  - title: Kung Fu Fighting
    artist: Carl Douglas
    notes:
      - Novelty song capitalizing on the Kung-Fu craze of the early '70s
      - By the way, the "Oriental Riff" we usually associate with Far East, is actually originally from a Turkish stageplay of Aladdin
      - Even though it's probably a bit dated by today's standards, I still think this is a good novelty song; it's just well-done
  - title: Cat's in the Cradle
    artist: Harry Chapin
    notes:
      - Song about a rocky Son-Father relationship
      - Wow, a sitar! it's been a while since we heard one of those!
      - Each verse is a nice little slice of the boy's upbringing; good storytelling
      - The chorus lyrics make no sense to me, I guess I'm too young to get the metaphors
  - title: Angie Baby
    artist: Helen Reddy
    notes:
      - Song about "Rock N' Roll can make your daughter hallucinate!" or something like that I duuno
      - It's okay I guess; kinda tacky
