numberOnes:
  - title: Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head
    artist: B.J. Thomas
    notes:
      - A nice swingy pop song; it surprisingly personifies a light rainy day very well
      - A nice trumpet is sprinkled throughout the song
      - I kinda like how the song picks up pace during the outro
  - title: I Want You Back
    artist: The Jackson 5
    notes:
      - 'The first #1 for Michael Jackson at age 11'
      - I really like the up and down nature of the bass line, really funky!
      - That chorus is just great, especially with those backing vocals
  - title: Venus
    artist: Shocking Blue
    notes:
      - Extremely catchy psychedelic folk song
      - The chorus is just fantastic... "She's got it! Ooh baby she's got it!"
      - I like that little guitar solo after the first verse
      - That reverberated vocal line in the middle is also great
  - title: Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) / Everybody Is a Star
    artist: Sly & The Family Stone
    notes:
      - Did the band have a stroke when naming this song?
      - Our first pop-n-slap bassline; we are now getting into some funky territory now
      - It's surprisingly simple with very little instrumentation; very effective with very little
      - Another great chorus this year! "Thank you... for lettin' me... be myself!"
      - '"Everybody Is a Star" is a nice, relaxed, relief from the overload of funk from "Thank You". Sometimes you just gotta take a break!'
  - title: Bridge Over Troubled Water
    artist: Simon & Garfunkel
    notes:
      - A piano ballad sung by Art Garfunkel about being there for a friend
      - Extremely emotional and very sincere
      - When Paul Simon comes in on the third verse, it sends this song into the stratosphere
      - The build-up to that cannon shot on the final chorus line is absolutely legendary
  - title: Let It Be
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - Wow, another legendary piano ballad!
      - A great message; a song to de-escalate just about any situation
  - title: ABC
    artist: Jackson 5
    notes:
      - It's like an even more upbeat and catchy version of the last Jackson 5 song
      - The song's lyrics are kind of silly, but considering it's being sung by an 11-year Michael Jackson it makes sense
  - title: American Woman / No Sugar Tonight
    artist: The Guess Who
    notes:
      - I have a sneaking suspicion that the "American Woman" in this song is a metaphor for America itself...
      - That tremolo guitar riff with that fuzzy guitar lead is far out maaaaan!
      - There's also a pretty solid groove with the rhythm section on this one
      - Funny enough, I actually like the B-Side "No Sugar Tonight" better; kind of wish it was the A-side instead
  - title: Everything Is Beautiful
    artist: Ray Stevens
    notes:
      - A World Peace anthem; just buy everyone a Coke, and everything will be alright, right?
      - As jovial as the song is, I can't imagine it actually brought people together that much
      - Can't say I like the double key change towards the end
  - title: The Long And Winding Road / For You Blue
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - 'The Beatles final #1 hit, a month after they broke up'
      - 'They had 20 #1 hits; my God...'
      - A very emotional, orchestral song
      - This really does feel like a nice send off for the Beatles, it's almost like the song is them riding off into the sunset
      - The B-side "For You Blue" is nice little blues song sung by George Harrison; a welcome addition
  - title: The Love You Save
    artist: The Jackson 5
    notes:
      - Can't say I like this one that much, I feel like they were pushing Michael really hard on this one and it shows
      - The instrumentation keeps this song from being bad; can't go wrong with a solid funk foundation
  - title: '"Mama Told Me (Not To Come)'
    artist: Three Dog Night
    notes:
      - '"Don''t go to parties if they are doing copious amounts of drugs and alcohol" The Song'
      - That main organ riff under the whole song is just great
      - A great chorus with great instrumentation
  - title: (They Long to Be) Close to You
    artist: The Carpenters
    notes:
      - A nice little soft-rock love song
      - Karen Carpenter's vocals are pretty good; a shame how she died
  - title: Make It with You
    artist: Bread
    notes:
      - A very underrated soft rock band; I always thought they should have be bigger then they were
      - Whenever people ask me what kind of music I like, I tell them "I listen to everything from Bread to Cannibal Corpse."
      - Very tight playing and stupidly-well composed, especially with that string section
  - title: War
    artist: Edwin Starr
    notes:
      - Probably the single-most recognizable anti-war song... and very deserving. This is a damn jam!
      - One of the most contagiously catchy songs every written; too good!
  - title: Ain't No Mountain High Enough
    artist: Diana Ross
    notes:
      - Ross was always meant to break away from The Supremes; she was always better solo... at least I think so.
      - Despite the dawdling talking sections, the instrumentation and chorus is just outstanding
  - title: Cracklin' Rosie
    artist: Neil Diamond
    notes:
      - Now Neil Diamond is in the spotlight instead of some other band playing his songs!
      - The "play it now! play it now! play it now my baby!" break after each chorus is THE right way to stop a song
  - title: I'll Be There
    artist: The Jackson 5
    notes:
      - A slow love song from the Jacksons
      - I really like the harpsichord underneath the song
      - Despite not being their wheelhouse, I actually think this is better than their upbeat songs
  - title: I Think I Love You
    artist: The Partridge Family
    notes:
      - '"Hey everybody! Check it out! It''s the White Jackson 5!"'
      - As obvious that this is a product to be sold, I can't say the music is bad; it's well done
      - The sort of gypsy/bohemian style of the song is quite nice; feels like a song you'd hear in a stage-play
  - title: The Tears of a Clown
    artist: Smokey Robinson & The Miracles
    notes:
      - It's like a fusion of a renaissance fair and an episode of Soul Train
      - Smokey's falsetto is very good, but the overbearing tambourine masks it too much
  - title: My Sweet Lord / Isn't It a Pity
    artist: George Harrison
    notes:
      - 'It barely took a few months before one of The Beatles scored a #1 hit after their breakup'
      - A very religious song that like SUPER inclusive, as the lyrics mention a plethora of deities
      - Those slide guitar solos are addicting to listen to
      - The backing vocals are really what make this song great... "Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"
      - The B-side "Isn't It a Pity", as good as the lyrics are, kind of drags on for 7 minutes; it can be shorter for sure
