  - position: 1
    title: Faith
    artist: George Michael
    notes:
      - Crossover of '50s rock and '80s pop
      - I really like the church organ intro and how it dry cuts into that Bo Diddley rhythm
      - Great vocal performace from Michael; just solid work throughout
      - Perfectly timed electric and steel guitar solo; well-composed
      - Do yourself a favor and DO NOT listen to the cover of this song by Limp Bizkit
  - position: 2
    title: So Emotional
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - This one's got a bit of a more rock edge
      - It's got a neat guitar solo as well!
      - Nothing too special; it's a decent song
  - position: 3
    title: "\"Got My Mind Set on You'"
    artist: George Harrison
    notes:
      - "The last #1 for a former Beatle; originally done by James Ray in 1962"
      - Has got a very driving drum machine
      - This song's lyrics are just so lazy; I feel like the original songwriter could have squeezed in some other words besides "money" and "time"
      - It just feels so weird hearing George Harrison, the most spiritual and philisophical songwriter of the Beatles, doing a silly love song
  - position: 4
    title: The Way You Make Me Feel
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - I really love that triplet drum machine rhythm; so nice hearing that after so much "4-on-the-floor" this decade
      - Solid song composition; every key change and start-stop is so well done
      - Jackson giving a great vocal performace as always
  - position: 5
    title: Need You Tonight
    artist: INXS
    notes:
      - Funk/New wave song
      - Oh wow, this one's insanely funky! I'm impressed to hear this from a band from Australia
      - That little slinky guitar breakdown in the middle is soooo good
  - position: 6
    title: Could've Been
    artist: Tiffany
    notes:
      - Slow piano ballad
      - bah, another slow, boring, ballad; nothing special at all.
  - position: 7
    title: Seasons Change
    artist: Exposé
    notes:
      - "I really don't get this one; it's so dawdling and boring, I have no clue as to how a song like this was #1, let alone popular in the U.S."
  - position: 8
    title: Father Figure
    artist: George Michael
    notes:
      - Slow synth ballad
      - I really love those eastern scale runs on the synths; Nice to see some non-western music tools used in a pop song
      - Solid vocal work from Michael
      - Great chorus; that backup choir really makes it stand out
  - position: 9
    title: Never Gonna Give You Up
    artist: Rick Astley
    notes:
      - IT'S THE RICKROLL SONG!!! This song's music video on YouTube has over 1 billion views. That may because of it's used in a very popular meme called a "Rickroll" which has been a popular meme for over a decade now
      - Anyway it's an upbeat synthpop song... and it's actually pretty good too!
      - Very catchy chorus; very infectious
      - Not too much to say here; just a real solid pop song
  - position: 10
    title: Man in the Mirror
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - Slow ballad about self-reflection and self-improvement
      - The movement of the melody is top notch; real good songwriting
      - Great chorus; especially with that backing choir
      - After the first chorus when that drum machine comes in... fantastic!
      - Wow, a good deployment of an "upward key-change" at the half-way point
      - This song's got one of the longest outros ever... and it's good! That low bass note with the backing choir complementing Jackson's improv is just fantastic
  - position: 11
    title: Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car
    artist: Billy Ocean
    notes:
      - Upbeat Synthpop/Dance-pop song
      - As silly as the lyrics are, the performace of the chorus is really good; very catchy!
      - Solid sax work on this one
      - Another good "upward key-change"! Two in a row! Nice!
  - position: 12
    title: Where Do Broken Hearts Go
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - Slow ballad
      - Eh, this one's okay; nothing too special
  - position: 13
    title: Wishing Well
    artist: Terence Trent D'Arby
    notes:
      - Funk song
      - That's one hell of a unique voice; so raspy yet powerful
      - It may sound a little silly, but I really do like those woodwinds after each chorus
      - It's nice and minimal; I like songs that do a lot with just a little!
  - position: 14
    title: Anything for You
    artist: Gloria Estefan & Miami Sound Machine
    notes:
      - Slow ballad
      - Has a nice little classical guitar solo in it
      - Nothing too special; it's actually kinda boring If I'm honest
  - position: 15
    title: One More Try
    artist: George Michael
    notes:
      - Very somber ballad
      - I really like that synth intro; so angelic
      - The song has this traditional pop '50s feel to it; I like it
      - Solid vocal work from Michael on this one; good range and control
      - The lyrics are kinda interesting; The whole song is basically "I will not love you. I've had my heart broken too many times to do this again" but then on the very last line, he caves in and say "maybe, just one more try"
  - position: 16
    title: Together Forever
    artist: Rick Astley
    notes:
      - It's like a dollar-store version of "Never Gonna Give You Up" but in a minor-key
      - Honestly not that impressive; much less fun than his last hit
  - position: 17
    title: Foolish Beat
    artist: Debbie Gibson
    notes:
      - 'Another boring and uninteresting pop ballad; another case of "how the hell did this go to #1?"'
  - position: 18
    title: Dirty Diana
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - Whoa, this is one spooky intro
      - Oh man, that bass synth line combined with that gritty guitar riff...
      - That's one hell of a guitar solo!
      - This is probably the grittiest song Michael Jackson has ever done; it's almost like a metal song
  - position: 19
    title: The Flame
    artist: Cheap Trick
    notes:
      - "Cheap Trick had a #1 hit? In 1988 of all years?!"
      - It's power ballad, by the way
      - Meh, nothing too special; Pales in comparison to their earlier stuff from the '70s
  - position: 20
    title: Hold On to the Nights
    artist: Richard Marx
    notes:
      - My God, can we go just a couple songs before we get ANOTHER slow, boring, and dawdling ballad?
  - position: 21
    title: Roll With It
    artist: Steve Winwood
    notes:
      - 'This was the last #1 hit that Casey Kasem did for his "American Top 40" show, from 1970 to 1988'
      - It's nice to hear some blues music after all of that synth we've heard so far this decade
      - It's a good song, but it's really nothing too special; just a solid blues song
  - position: 22
    title: Monkey
    artist: George Michael
    notes:
      - Dance-pop song
      - Very catchy song; hard to not dance to
      - I really like that guitar that is sprinkled throughout; very nice and subtle
      - It's just a really good dance song
  - position: 23
    title: Sweet Child O' Mine
    artist: Guns N' Roses
    notes:
      - Hard rock ballad
      - I've got a confession; I really don't like Guns N' Roses all that much. I just never got into them. However, I will admit that this is a good song. Well, at least compared to all the other pop hits
      - Great guitar riff, great chord progession, good lyrics, solid instrumentation. My only complaint is Axl Rose's voice. I just can't stand it!
      - Let's not ignore the absolute legendary guitar solo performed by Slash; outstanding virtuosity!
  - position: 24
    title: Don't Worry Be Happy
    artist: Bobby McFerrin
    notes:
      - Reggae A capella song; featured in the flim "Cocktail"
      - Probably the most laid-back song every written; it's so care-free that I would imagine if you played this in your workplace, productivity would plummet
      - Just fantastic vocal work by McFerrin
  - position: 25
    title: Love Bites
    artist: Def Leppard
    notes:
      - Power ballad
      - 'How did this become a #1 hit but not "Pour Some Sugar On Me"? That song is clearly the superior song, and it just missed the top spot at #2!'
      - I'm mean it's not terrible, but it's really not that great either; if you listen to the album this song is on, there are many better songs than this one
  - position: 26
    title: Red Red Wine
    artist: UB40
    notes:
      - Written by Neil Diamond, this reggae cover by UB40 was originally recorded in 1983, but found new popularity after being performed at Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday concert
      - This is probably the best Neil Diamond cover I've ever heard; this song was made to be a reggae song!
  - position: 27
    title: A Groovy Kind of Love
    artist: Phil Collins
    notes:
      - Cover of The Mindbenders song from 1965; recorded for the film "Buster" starring Phil Collins
      - It's a good cover, but I don't think this song was made to be a soft, piano ballad. Phil does a good job translating it into one, but you can only do so much with it
  - position: 28
    title: Kokomo
    artist: The Beach Boys
    notes:
      - Recorded for the film "Cocktail"
      - Ladies and Gentleman, THIS is what you get when The Beach Boys write a song WITHOUT Brian Wilson. A complete tragedy is what you get!
      - The caribbean theme is just so cheesy and the mixing is so poorly done, I can't believe The Beach Boys would sink this low whoring out their "surf & summer" image
  - position: 29
    title: Wild, Wild West
    artist: The Escape Club
    notes:
      - Nothing more wild west cowboy than a London, UK band doing a pop rock song
      - It's kind of catchy, but the rap verses are just so cheesy and forced
      - I wil give the song credit for sounding like a '90s song while having the lyric "heading for the '90s, living in the wild, wild west"
  - position: 30
    title: Bad Medicine
    artist: Bon Jovi
    notes:
      - Glam metal song
      - This just sounds so phoned-in; I guess this song's a classic to some, but it ain't to me
  - position: 31
    title: Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley
    artist: Will to Power
    notes:
      - Synth-pop cover of the Peter Frampton song and the Lynyrd Skynyrd song
      - It's an okay cover; There's really nothing to special about it. I think what makes a good cover is when it feels like it's own song seperate from the original. However this just feels like a lazy synthpop cover which is what this song is
  - position: 32
    title: Look Away
    artist: Chicago
    notes:
      - Power ballad; vocals performed by Bill Champlin
      - It feels so weird to hear a Chicago song without horns; it's like the lifeblood of the band
      - Honestly, it's not half-bad for a standard power ballad; I guess when your part of a band with extremely talent and seasoned musicians, you're a notch above most other groups doing power ballads
  - position: 33
    title: Every Rose Has Its Thorn
    artist: Poison
    notes:
      - Glam rock/Acoustic power ballad
      - "It's cool that even in 1988, a solid open-chord guitar song can reach #1"
      - It's not too bad; Solid songwriting from Poison
