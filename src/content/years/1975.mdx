commentary: Very similar to last year; another "meh" year. Disco has now been firmly planted into the charts, and it looks like there's no stopping it. Kinda wishing we were already into the post-disco era, as I always thought that what was inspired by disco was always better than disco itself.
year: 1975
numberOnes:
  - title: Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
    artist: Elton John
    notes:
      - Cover of the Beatles song
      - A faithful enough cover; if anything, it's less "out there" and more palatable to a general audience
  - title: Mandy
    artist: Barry Manilow
    notes:
      - Slow piano ballad
      - Has a nice chorus; can't say much else, pretty standard affair
  - title: Please Mr. Postman
    artist: The Carpenters
    notes:
      - 'Cover of The Marvelettes #1 hit song from 1961'
      - Pretty standard cover, it sounds almost exactly the same besides the fact that the mixing is better and it's got Karen Carpenter singing it
      - Has a nice sax and guitar solo in it
  - title: Laughter In The Rain
    artist: Neil Sedaka
    notes:
      - Oh god, the "shooby-dooby-doo-wop" Sedaka is back
      - Actually, I'm impressed. Instead of being unbearably doo-woppy, he's taken well to the '70s sound
      - Good chorus; I like the stacked vocals
      - There's even a nice pleasant sax solo in it!
  - title: Fire
    artist: Ohio Players
    notes:
      - Insanely funky song
      - Bad-ass guitar solo in the middle
      - Kind of one-note overall; it would sound good in a disco/club, but that's about it
  - title: You're No Good
    artist: Linda Ronstadt
    notes:
      - Catchy chorus; blends rock with funk well enough
      - That little dissonant guitar break in the middle is great; rarely seen in a pop song
      - I even like the guitar solo as well
  - title: Pick Up the Pieces
    artist: Average White Band
    notes:
      - Funk instrumental
      - Hot damn, there's nothing AVERAGE about this band. They're friggin' MASTERS of funk!
      - Everything about this piece is just great; the horns, the guitar, the drum groove, the hype-man vocals in the back, it's just great!
      - Now THAT'S one hell of a sax solo!
  - title: Best of My Love
    artist: The Eagles
    notes:
      - Real nice strummed 12-string acoustic guitar chords; very pleasant
      - Besides that, it's nothing too special; it' just kind of drags out for 3 and a half minutes
  - title: Have You Never Been Mellow
    artist: Olivia Newton-John
    notes:
      - Is that a threat, Olivia?
      - The chorus is kind of good; everything else is just boring
      - I really don't think Newton-John's voice is that great. I mean, it's on point but it's so airy and plain that's it's putting me to sleep
  - title: Black Water
    artist: The Doobie Brothers
    notes:
      - Delta bluesy/bluegrass song
      - I really love that chord progression, especially during the chorus
      - Wow, a fiddle solo! Can't say I've seen one of those yet
      - When those drums kick in, it turns it into one hell of a funky song
      - Nice a-cappella outro
  - title: My Eyes Adored You
    artist: Frankie Valli
    notes:
      - Song about a hopeless romantic
      - The lyrics are so on-the-nose that it would be hard miss
      - Valli even flexes his fortune and fame for a verse; wow, sooooo cool
      - Needless key change; you can tell when they've run out ideas to spice up a song when they do that
  - title: Lady Marmalade
    artist: Labelle
    notes:
      - Funky song about a prostitute
      - I like the "go sister, go!" bit by the backing vocals
      - Wow, first time I've heard french lyrics since the Singing Nun
      - It's a good song; but I can't say it's anything too special
  - title: Lovin' You
    artist: Minnie Riperton
    notes:
      - Slow, boring love song
      - Plain lyrics, very low-effort "la la la la"
      - Riperton is needlessly hitting high notes on a song that really isn't interesting enough to warrant it
  - title: Philadelphia Freedom
    artist: The Elton John Band
    notes:
      - Elton John's attempt to capitalize on the Philadelphia Soul sound
      - Honestly, it's really not that good. I mean, it's not bad, but it's just too plain
      - Also this song really should only be like 2 and a half minutes long; it's way too long
  - title: (Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song
    artist: B.J. Thomas
    notes:
      - Hey, I think the song title isn't long enough
      - Real one-note song; nothing all that interesting about it
      - I guess it has a nice bouncy quality to it, that's about it
  - title: He Don't Love You (Like I Love You)
    artist: Tony Orlando & Dawn
    notes:
      - Another plain love song; easily confused with many others like it
  - title: Shining Star
    artist: Earth, Wind & Fire
    notes:
      - You know, I've always thought Earth, Wind & Fire was the better funk band of the '70s
      - All of the instruments come together to create something space-age about this groove
      - That little shred guitar solo in the middle is awesome
      - Amazing vocals and lyrics; very positive!
  - title: Before the Next Teardrop Falls
    artist: Freddy Fender
    notes:
      - A nice little slow Tejano song
      - Wow, I really like this; I think Fender's voice is great and it's neat to hear some Spanish lyrics in a pop song
  - title: Thank God I'm a Country Boy
    artist: John Denver
    notes:
      - A very upbeat folk/bluegrass song
      - Great and funny lyrics; well-performed especially with those backing vocals
      - Outstanding fiddle and banjo solos throughout
  - title: Sister Golden Hair
    artist: America
    notes:
      - This is what The Eagles wish they sounded like
      - Just a great folk rock song; everyone's performance is outstanding
  - title: Love Will Keep Us Together
    artist: Captain & Tennille
    notes:
      - This song sounds like all of the instruments are Fisher-Price toy instruments XD
      - It's a nice upbeat song; but I can't say it's anything too special
  - title: Listen to What The Man Said
    artist: Paul McCartney & Wings
    notes:
      - Besides the trotting-horse rhythm and tenor sax; it's a really one-note song
      - I guess I like that slow outro
  - title: The Hustle
    artist: Van McCoy & The Soul City Symphony
    notes:
      - Disco pseudo-instrumental
      - I like the piccolo lead; it's a little tacky but it has a charm to it
      - The horn section is also pretty good too!
      - Overall, it's a nice little instrumental; although nothing too special
  - title: One of These Nights
    artist: The Eagles
    notes:
      - The Eagles go disco!
      - I love that bass line in the intro; real good!
      - I also love that tone on the lead guitar; very unique!
      - Great guitar work by Don Felder on this track
      - Honestly, as hilarious as it is to see a rock band do a straight-disco song, it's actually not half-bad
  - title: Jive Talkin'
    artist: Bee Gees
    notes:
      - 'First Disco #1 hit by the Bee Gees'
      - I really like the use of the analog synth on this track; really makes it stand out from everything else
      - The little synth bit after each chorus is great
  - title: Fallin' in Love
    artist: Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds
    notes:
      - Real boring, one-note love song; sometimes soft rock can be a little too soft.
  - title: Get Down Tonight
    artist: KC & The Sunshine Band
    notes:
      - One of the most disco sounding songs I've ever heard
      - The sped-up guitar track is an interesting idea, and it sounds pretty good to be honest
      - Kind of a catchy chorus, but really only something I'd only like to hear at a disco/club
  - title: Rhinestone Cowboy
    artist: Glen Campbell
    notes:
      - Pop-country song
      - The chorus ain't half-bad!
      - It's a nice song, but I really don't think it's anything special
  - title: Fame
    artist: David Bowie
    notes:
      - As a big fan of Bowie, I just want to mention that this song is far from representative of his sound. He can be pretty "out there" with his music
      - That back-masked intro is just great!
      - It's funny how distinctly Bowie this sounds despite being a straight-funk song
      - I like this one; it's like a much gritter and rough sounding disco track compared to everything else coming out at the time
  - title: I'm Sorry
    artist: John Denver
    notes:
      - Folk ballad
      - It's well-done; good chord progression
      - A little to mopey for my liking; but Denver's talent is undisputed here
  - title: Bad Blood
    artist: Neil Sedaka
    notes:
      - I like the bass on this one; sounds real meaty
      - A bit more upbeat then his other songs
      - Not much else I can say; it's a decent song
  - title: Island Girl
    artist: Elton John
    notes:
      - Insanely good groove with the bass and drums
      - Maybe the marimba is a little too tacky for my tastes
      - I like the slide electric-guitar after the choruses; sounds good and goes well with the bass and drums
      - Not a half-bad song
  - title: That's the Way (I Like It)
    artist: KC & The Sunshine Band
    notes:
      - I like the call-response chorus line, but it can be a little repetitive
      - Besides the main-line, it really does sound just like their last hit
  - title: Fly Robin Fly
    artist: Silver Convention
    notes:
      - Ooh, some GERMAN disco
      - I really like that main bass line; sounds real tough
      - As good and groovy as the song is, it drags on for waaaayyy too long
  - title: Let's Do It Again
    artist: The Staple Singers
    notes:
      - Funk song written for the film of the same name
      - As nice and laid back as the song is, it's nothing too special
