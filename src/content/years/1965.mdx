commentary: An even better year. It's starting to get really good now. Much more honed then before. Or maybe it's just my biases; I'm starting to recognize most of these songs now, and I can't say I didn't already like them.

      - The "Stop! In the naaaame of loooove!" lyric is just too iconic to not love
      - The straight-drum beat is a little monotonous but the horn section makes up for it
  - title: I'm Telling You Now
    artist: Freddie & The Dreamers
    notes:
      - The guitar intro is kinda punk (early garage rock sound?)
      - A little too standard of a love song for me, but the British Invasion influence is welcome

    artist: Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders
    notes:
      - The drums and bass are kick-ass on this song!
      - Very creative vocal parts; well harmonized
      - You can tell they were influenced heavily by Elvis

    notes:
      - The muted guitar chords have a mandolin sound to them; I like it
      - The vocals are painfully british, but well performed
      - The key change at the end of each chorus is pretty neat
  - title: Ticket to Ride
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - The jangly guitar with the staggard drum beat is quite hypnotic
      - Very catchy chorus (same for the upbeat bridge as well!)
      - The "myyyyyy baby don't care" outro is also great
  - title: Help Me, Rhonda
    artist: The Beach Boys
    notes:
      - The chipper guitar bits just make this sad song a bit less so
      - Amazing vocals on the chorus; elevates this song into an angelic chorus
      - The boogie-woogie piano/guitar break in the middle just makes this song that much better

      - A very welcome Sax solo!
      - The stings behind the vocals make it much more soulful
  - title: Mr. Tambourine Man
    artist: The Byrds
    notes:
      - The guitar intro is very inviting for such a sad song
      - The somber vocals and guitar play off each other sooooo well
      - I just can't get over how amazing the 12-string guitar sounds
  - title: (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    notes:
      - 'First Stones song to reach #1'
      - That guitar tone... that damned guitar tone... it's too damn good!
      - The "I can't get no!" lyric is anthemic as hell
      - Very punk sounding; I can see why so may punk bands of the '70s cited The Rolling Stones as their main influence
  - title: Henry The VII, I Am
    artist: Herman's Hermits
    notes:
      - A short chipper song; kind of silly but fun nonetheless
      - '"Second verse, same as the first!" line is just too damn funny'
      - A very welcome guitar solo in the middle
  - title: I Got You Babe
    artist: Sonny & Cher
    notes:
      - A neat little love song
      - The oboe is a nice touch, but the xylophone is a little too tacky for me
      - Cher's vocals are a league above Sonny's
  - title: Help!
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - The backing vocals behind the lead vocal are absolutely amazing
      - The "pleeeeease pleeeeeease help me" lyric with the little guitar flurry behind it is very catchy
  - title: Eve of Destruction
    artist: Barry McGuire
    notes:
      - 'First protest song to reach #1'
      - A little too on-the-nose; the song could've used some subtlety
      - The vocals are just a little too forced for my liking
  - title: Hang on Sloopy
    artist: The McCoys
    notes:
      - A neat little song; but al little too plain
      - The call-response "yeah!" is kind of neat
  - title: Yesterday
    artist: The Beatles
    notes:
      - An acoustic piece from Paul McCartney
      - Very sincere sounding, and an amazing chorus
      - The backing strings really make this song legendary
  - title: Get Off of My Cloud
    artist: Rolling Stones
    notes:
      - I like the stab-y distorted guitar, it's got attitude!
      - The shout-y chorus makes it quite the rebel anthem
  - title: I Hear a Symphony
    artist: The Supremes
    notes:
      - The reverberated xylophone really makes the song so so much fuller
      - The key changes as the song goes on and builds up do well with making the song sound somber
  - title: Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)
    artist: The Byrds
    notes:
      - The jangly guitars on this song are absolutely legendary
      - The vocals are just straight-up haunting, especially considering the biblical references
      - The little guitar break in the middle is angelic to listen to
  - title: Over and Over
    artist: The Dave Clark Five
    notes:
      - Very repetitive; it's literally just one note being held on a sax the whole song
      - At least it's got a harmonica solo in the middle...
