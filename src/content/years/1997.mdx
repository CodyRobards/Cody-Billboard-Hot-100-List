commentary: Not a good year AT ALL; very disappointing that Biggie Smalls was the only act that I really enjoyed this year. I just really hope that when we get to the '00s, it's not this drab and boring.
year: 1997
numberOnes:
  - title: Un-Break My Heart
    artist: Toni Braxton
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song
      - Honestly, this one's kinda lame; it's so melodramtic and very predictable
  - title: Wannabe
    artist: Spice Girls
    notes:
      - "All-girl singer group; first and only #1 hit for Spice Girls"
      - The hard cut between the verses and choruses are jarring and out of place
      - These lyrics are just so low-effort and make no sense
      - I really have no clue as to how this is considered a classic of the '90s; It's so tacky and poorly done
      - I guess the "I wanna (huh), I wanna (huh)... etc." lyric is kinda neat; has a rhythmic quality to it
  - title: Can't Nobody Hold Me Down
    artist: Puff Daddy feat. Masekela
    notes:
      - Oh hell yeah, a Grandmaster Flash sample! Nice to hear it
      - Honestly, Puff Daddy's vocal performance sounds so flat and bored. You're supposed to sound large and in-charge, man!
      - The poor vocal performance is carried into the failed attempts to sing the lyrics to the "Break My Stride" by Matthew Wilder
      - Besides the one good sample choice, It's really just not all that great
  - title: Hypnotize
    artist: The Notorious B.I.G.
    notes:
      - "Another posthumous #1 hit, 2 months after Biggie Smalls murder"
      - "Samples another #1 hit from 1979, Herp Alpert's \"Rise\"; mainly the guitar riff"
      - Solid beat; great bassline and drums
      - Lyrical execution from Biggie Smalls is top-notch; not super aggressive, but still has a dominating presence over the song
      - Overall a pretty good song; It's always a shame when an artist's life is cut so short
  - title: MMMBop
    artist: Hanson
    notes:
      - Wow, we went from Gangsta rap to upbeat "sunshine and rainbows"; this is a teeny-bopper pop-rock song
      - I like that guitar riff that plays throughout the song
      - Very upbeat and "sweet", but in a sugar-coated way
      - I will say that it's a lot better than the bubblegum pop from the '60s, but no mattter how they try and spin it, this is still bubblegum pop
  - title: I'll Be Missing You
    artist: Puff Daddy & Faith Evans feat. 112
    notes:
      - 'Tribute song to the life of Biggie Smalls; samples #1 hit from The Police, "Every Breath You Take"'
      - "I can tell that this was a geniune tribute, Puff Daddy being a close musical partner to Biggie and Evans being his widow; probably making this the saddest song to ever hit #1"
      - As genuine as this song is, I can't but help but feel that this is a weak performance. It really could have been soooo much better, but this one falls flat for me
  - title: Mo Money Mo Problems
    artist: The Notorious B.I.G. feat. Puff Daddy & Muse
    notes:
      - "Another posthumous #1 hit for Biggie Smalls, this time featuring his former musical partner Puff Daddy"
      - Samples Diana Ross' "I'm Coming Out"; has a sort of funk/disco feel to it
      - Puff Daddy's performance is a little better this time, but still fairly flat overall
      - Biggie's verses are the best part; solid flow, great delivery. Really just goes to show you how much more talented he was compared to Puff Daddy
  - title: Honey
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - "Carey's first #1 to be a \"Hip hop\" song, as opposed to the typical R&B she's used to; Cowritten by Puff Daddy"
      - Another great sampling choice, this time it's "Hey DJ" by World-Famous Supreme Team, and "The Body Rock" bt the Treacherous Three
      - Can't say I like Carey's vocal performance on this one, instead of being controlled and powerful, it's instead whispy and airy; not her strong suit
  - title: 4 Seasons Of Lonelessness
    artist: Boyz II Men
    notes:
      - "Final #1 hit for Boyz II Men; I guess it's fitting that it's next to a Mariah Carey song, the other big hit group of the '90s"
      - Very similar vocally to "One Sweet Day" from 1995; but a lot less powerful this time
      - As good as their vocal performances are here, the song as a whole is really just putting me to sleep; a shame for them to end on such a low note
  - title: Candle In The Wind 1997/Something About the Way You Look Tonight
    artist: Elton John
    notes:
      - '"Candle In The Wind 1997"'
      - A re-recording of John's 1973 hit, a tribute to the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died earlier in 1997
      - It's an okay re-recording, the '90s production sheen really takes away the simple charm of the original; I definitely perfer the original
      - '"Something About the Way You Look Tonight"'
      - Solid chorus; well performed
      - Everything else around the chorus is just "meh"; John is definitely well out of his prime here
