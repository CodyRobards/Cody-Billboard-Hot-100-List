commentary: "Wow... only 9 #1 hits this year. Anyway, this one was alright; not too exciting. Very little variety and what was here wasn't anything too special. Not to say it was bad, but once again; it lacked the \"oomph\" previous years had."

    title: One Sweet Day
    artist: Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song about mourning the death of a loved one; implied that they were a victim of the AIDs epidemic
      - What do you get when you take the world's biggest female pop star of 1995 and have her collaborate with the world's biggest music group of 1995?
      - "...you get the longest running #1 hit song for 24 years, that's what! This song was #1 for 16 consectutive weeks, and wouldn't be surpassed until 2019. So does it stack up?"
      - ...I would say yeah, it does! The song is very somber and sad, and Carey and Boyz II Men play off each other very well here; they're performances really hammer home the message of the song
      - That chorus is so angelic; very fitting that the lyrics are about meeting them again in heaven
  - position: 2
    title: Because You Loved Me
    artist: Céline Dion
    notes:
      - Slow pop ballad
      - Eh, it's okay; Dion's vocal performance is good, but it's hardly anything to get excited about
  - position: 3
    title: Always By My Baby
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo love song
      - Very happy sounding
      - Good vocal harmonies during the chorus
      - "Solid song; it's good, but I liked her previous #1 hits more"
  - position: 4
    title: Tha Crossroads
    artist: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
    notes:
      - I guess these guys were like the edgier version of Boyz II Men
      - Solid rap flows from all involved; not half-bad harmonies either
      - As good as the performances are, the production and mixing really make it feel tacky
  - position: 5
    title: How Do U Want It/California Love
    artist: 2Pac feat. K-Ci & Jojo/feat. Dr. Dre & Roger Troutman
    notes:
      - "Double single; 2Pac's only #1 hit just 2 months before his murder"
      - '"How Do U Want It"'
      - That bassline under the verses and choruses is mezmerizing
      - Great chorus; solid vocal harmonies
      - '"California Love"'
      - That accending chromatic piano riff is straight-up badass!
      - Solid lyrics and performance by 2Pac
      - I'll be frank, I really don't think the talkbox vocals from Roger Troutman fit the song all that well
  - position: 6
    title: You're Makin' Me High"/"Let It Flow
    artist: Toni Braxton
    notes:
      - "\"You're Makin' Me High\""
      - Mid-tempo R&B song
      - Solid groove throughout the whole song
      - The vocal performace from Braxton fits the song so well
      - '"Let It Flow"'
      - Included on the soundtrack of the flim "Waiting to Exhale"
      - I really like that acoustic guitar riff with that electric guitar underneath it; really makes the song feel dreamy
      - Another good vocal performace; this time very restrained
  - position: 7
    title: Macarena (Bayside Boys Mix)
    artist: Los del Río
    notes:
      - Dance-pop remix of a Latin pop song from 1993
      - Oh god, it's the Macarena. This damn song...
      - The valley girl verse sections cringy as hell and not performed well AT ALL
      - Honestly the vocals from Los del Río are really the only good part; they have a good cadence
      - The actual song underneath it is also not half-bad; but sum of it's parts do not make-up for the whole
  - position: 8
    title: No Diggity
    artist: Blackstreet feat. Dr. Dre & Queen Pen
    notes:
      - Nice and minimalistic Rap/R&B song; an amazing drum beat
      - I really like that Bill Withers sample looped throughout the song; great selection
      - Dr. Dre coming out of the gate to set the tone of the song; top-notch work in the first 30 seconds
      - Great vocal performances from everyone in Blackstreet; a nice variety of vocal timbres
      - Hell, even Queen Pen's verse is pretty good!
  - position: 9
    title: Un-Break My Heart
    artist: Toni Braxton
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song
      - Honestly, this one's kinda lame; it's so melodramtic and very predictable
