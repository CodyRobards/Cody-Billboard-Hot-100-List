commentary: "This was a VERY good year! The variety was a bit lacking, but what we did get was some of the best R&B/Rap we've heard so far. You can tell that everyone that had a #1 hit this year really honed their craft to create something special."
year: 1995
numberOnes:
  - title: On Bended Knee
    artist: Boyz II Men
    notes:
      - First time an artist replaced itself at the top spot since The Beatles in 1964
      - "A much more tamer performance this time around; unlike the massive epic songs they've had reach #1, this one's much more restrained"
      - I really wish I could say something that hasn't already been said; it's just a good song in of itself
  - title: Creep
    artist: TLC
    notes:
      - I always thought that TLC was the natural extension of the kind of Rap/R&B crossover stuff that Salt-N-Pepa originally did
      - Those drums are on-point
      - Great chorus; those vocal harmonies are out of this world
      - It's cool to see an all female vocal group singing in a lower register than most others
  - title: Take a Bow
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - Mid-tempo pop ballad; co-written by Babyface, who also wrote most of Boyz II Men's hits
      - It definitely shows; it sounds like Madonna singing a Boyz II Men song
      - Y'know, this actually reminds me of a Carpenters song; Madonna's voice is very similar to Karen Carpenter's here
      - It's not half-bad; a very honed and well-made pop song
  - title: This Is How We Do It
    artist: Montell Jordan
    notes:
      - 'First #1 hit song from Def Jam Records; this is from the "Golden Era" of west-coast rap'
      - Jordan's voice is not only very melodic, but his flow is also on-point here
      - The "This is how we do it!" refrain during the chorus is too catchy to not sing
  - title: Have You Every Really Loved a Woman?
    artist: Bryan Adams
    notes:
      - Soft rock ballad written for the film "Don Juan DeMarco"; centers around the spanish guitar
      - Besides some really good guitar work, I can't say it's anything too special
  - title: Waterfalls
    artist: TLC
    notes:
      - "We've finally made it to the song that was #1 the week I was born!"
      - I like how "Stevie Wonder" sounding this song is; I'm sure he's proud of TLC here
      - A pretty sad song covering a whole bunch of topics; but despite all of that, the song has a sort of sober optimism to it
      - Very solid chorus; really hammers home the message of the song
  - title: Kiss from a Rose
    artist: Seal
    notes:
      - Progressive soul song featured in the film "Batman Forever"
      - That vocal intro is so ethereal and wispy; I like it
      - Seal's vocal performace is top-notch here, it's very acrobatic, has a wide-range, and is very powerful
      - I really love the wide breadth of instrumentation used throughout
      - That orchestral movement during the chorus is straight-up legendary
  - title: You Are Not Alone
    artist: Michael Jackson
    notes:
      - "The King of Pop's final #1 hit in his lifetime; love ballad written by R. Kelly"
      - As good as Jackson's vocal performance is here, this really should have just been an R. Kelly song; this really doesn't fit Jackson all that well
  - title: Gangsta's Paradise
    artist: Coolio feat. L.V.
    notes:
      - "Our first gangsta rap song to reach #1; the first-person ponderings of a gang leader"
      - That Stevie Wonder sample really sets the spooky, desperate tone of the song so well
      - I can't help but love a good story; Coolio's lyrics are just sooo good here. Truely Shakespearian quality.
      - L.V.'s vocals during the chorus really elevate this song to a higher level
      - "\"Tell me why are we so blind to see, that the one's we hurt are you and me?\" That is such a good lyric; absolutely amazing"
  - title: Fantasy
    artist: Mariah Carey
    notes:
      - Oh shit, is that "Genius of Love" by Tom-Tom Club I hear being sampled?
      - That chorus is so good; so many layers of vocals, all harmonized so well
      - Wow, Carey even sings some of the "Genius of Love" lyrics too!
      - Very impressive overall; it cool to see Carey with a good taste in '80s art rock
  - title: Exhale (Shoop Shoop)
    artist: Whitney Houston
    notes:
      - "Houston's final #1 hit song; slow R&B song"
      - Well, you can't say that Houston didn't change with the times. It basically sounds like an R. Kelly song
      - I mean hell, it was even written by Babyface!
      - Of course Houston's vocals are on-point here, but I can't say that I like the "shoop, shoop, shoop, shooby" backing vocal; kinda tacky
  - title: One Sweet Day
    artist: Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song about mourning the death of a loved one; implied that they were a victim of the AIDs epidemic
      - What do you get when you take the world's biggest female pop star of 1995 and have her collaborate with the world's biggest music group of 1995?
      - "...you get the longest running #1 hit song for 24 years, that's what! This song was #1 for 16 consectutive weeks, and wouldn't be surpassed until 2019. So does it stack up?"
      - ...I would say yeah, it does! The song is very somber and sad, and Carey and Boyz II Men play off each other very well here; they're performances really hammer home the message of the song
      - That chorus is so angelic; very fitting that the lyrics are about meeting them again in heaven
