commentary_excerpt: Now we are back done into the "meh"; no real stand-outs this year. I will say that the average quality of the songs is getting better, so I guess I have nothing to complain about.

year: 1981
numberOnes:
  - title: (Just Like) Starting Over
    artist: John Lennon
    notes:
      - "Another posthumous #1 hit; just two weeks after Lennon's murder"
      - It's like a rockabilly song kind of; definitely John trying to emulate the kind of music he grew up listening to
      - Not a half bad song; it's a damn shame his life was cut so short. I imagine he would have made some good tunes during the '80s
  - title: The Tide Is High
    artist: Blondie
    notes:
      - Reggae/ska song
      - A complete departure from their typical sound
      - Horn section sounds good
      - It's not half bad; it sounds good and all but it's nothing too special
  - title: Celebration
    artist: Kool & The Gang
    notes:
      - Upbeat funk song about a celebration!
      - Very catchy and singable
      - The lyrics are pretty simple but the instrumentation does good conveying the cheery mood of the song
  - title: 9 to 5
    artist: Dolly Parton
    notes:
      - Pop-country song about the daily grind
      - I don't know... sounds like COMMIE propaganda to me! Am I listening to Karl Marx or Dolly Parton?
      - In all seriousness, it's a pretty solid song; her voice is great and extremely catchy
  - title: I Love a Rainy Night
    artist: Eddie Rabbitt
    notes:
      - A swingy rockabilly song
      - Real good chorus; very catchy
      - I'm so glad that the production quality of your standard pop music has increased so much to the point that even a standard song like this one sounds good
  - title: Keep On Loving You
    artist: REO Speedwagon
    notes:
      - "First power ballad to reach #1; this will be a common occurance this decade..."
      - Really good piano and vocals on this one
      - Very powerful chorus
      - Another soft-spot song for me; It just sounds great but I can't figure out why
  - title: Rapture
    artist: Blondie
    notes:
      - It's like a weird combination of New wave, Funk, and Hip Hop
      - "I never would have guessed the first Rap song to reach #1 would have been a white girl..."
      - ...and it's absolutely garbage. It's like she's trying to freestyle the first words to come to her head and because of that, she's rapping about Martians coming down to Earth to eat cars and then she gets transformed into one of the car-eaters
      - Besides, that the chorus is really good and there's even a banger guitar solo towards the end but it can't make up for the terrible rapping
  - title: Kiss on My List
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    notes:
      - Nice little drum machine in the background
      - The pre-chorus and chorus are pretty good; Hall & Oates really were made to harmonize with one another
      - A very fitting guitar solo too; another amazing guitar tone as well!
  - title: Morning Train (Nine to Five)
    artist: Sheena Easton
    notes:
      - "Wow, TWO songs with the same name go to #1 within the same year; what a coincidence!"
      - "Eh, it's okay; I guess you could say this would be the first \"meh\" song with the '80s sound to reach #1"
  - title: Bette Davis Eyes
    artist: Kim Carnes
    notes:
      - Okay, this song REEKS of '80s; everything from the synth lines to the over-reverbed production is so '80s
      - That main synth is great; throughout the whole song it just fits so well
      - Carnes has a very distinct raspy voice, but I hate to say it... she is no Janis Joplin; can't say I like it
  - title: Stars On 45
    artist: Stars On 45
    notes:
      - Novelty medley made by Dutch studio musicians; it's a mish-mash of various hit songs from the past
      - Every 4 bars or so, they change the song
      - Surprisingly, it's all Beatles songs with the exception of "Sugar, Sugar" by The Archies, and "Venus" by Shocking Blue
      - "It's not half bad; each cover is done very faithfully to the original, but I can't imagine why something like this became a #1 hit"
  - title: The One That You Love
    artist: Air Supply
    notes:
      - Soft rock love song
      - Besides the fact that the vocal performace is pretty solid, it's really just a boring love song
      - '"When in doubt, just do a key change towards the end!" Says every boring love song songwriter'
  - title: Jessie's Girl
    artist: Rick Springfield
    notes:
      - Rock song about being jealous of a friend's girlfriend
      - I really like that main guitar riff; plays well with the vocals
      - Nice guitar solo as well
      - Just a solid rock song; not much else to say
  - title: Endless Love
    artist: Diana Ross & Lionel Richie
    notes:
      - Love song duet
      - I'm actually surprised; Richie managed to write a slow love ballad that sounds good here!
      - The chord progression and vocal performance are great; Ross sounds much better here when paired with Richie
      - I really like that last chorus; very powerful
  - title: Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)
    artist: Christopher Cross
    notes:
      - Theme written for the film "Arthur"
      - Not a half-bad sax solo in the middle
      - It's nothing too special, but it does sound like a better version of "Killing Me Softly with His Song"
  - title: Private Eyes
    artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates
    notes:
      - This one sounds very similar to "Kiss on My List", but I think this one sounds much better
  - title: Physical
    artist: Olivia Newton-John
    notes:
      - '#1 for 10 consectutive weeks, tieing "You Light Up My Life" by Debby Boone for the longest running #1 hit song'
      - There's a sort of delay-effect on Newton-John's vocals, it's kind of neat
      - Great guitar solo in the middle
      - It's an alright song; not something I would write home about
