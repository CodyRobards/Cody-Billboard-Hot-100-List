commentary: A much better year; the variety is back, and some real bangers too! This was the last year of the "oldies" era of U.S. Pop music before The Beatles came here and changed everything, and honestly I think it was for the better. A lot of these songs from 1958-1963 really do sound the same. If you put some of these songs on a playlist and shuffled it, I couldn't tell you what artist was playing or what year it came out. However, despite all of that, It all has a naive charm, and I appreciate them all for laying the ground work for better artists to come along and build upon it all.
year: 1963
numberOnes:
  - title: Telstar
    artist: The Tornados
    notes:
      - Is this the first prog-rock instrumental?
      - The rhythm is really skittish; disorienting, but not in a fun way
      - It's sounds like a western set in space
  - title: Go Away Little Girl
    artist: Steve Lawrence
    notes:
      - Yet another generic love song...
      - I will say the vocal multi-tracking sound a lot like something from Harry Nilsson
  - title: Walk Right In
    artist: The Rooftop Singers
    notes:
      - Some honest-to-God acoustic guitar music for once!
      - Great folk song; very catchy
      - Breaks the mold of the doo-wop stuff
      - The accending and decending licks sound like something from a '70s prog rock band
  - title: Hey Paula
    artist: Paul & Paula
    notes:
      - "\"Let's get married when we turn 18!\" The Duet"
      - Both singers sound good together for the most part
  - title: Walk Like a Man
    artist: The Four Seasons
    notes:
      - "Massive improvement to the previous #1's by these guys"
      - The chord progression and vocals are much better
      - The "walk... walk... walk..." backing vocals are great
  - title: Our Day Will Come
    artist: Ruby & the Romantics
    notes:
      - It's like the hybrid between Lounge and R&B
      - The xylophone is a little tacky
  - title: He's So Fine
    artist: The Chiffons
    notes:
      - "\"do-lang, do-lang, do-lang\" isn't too bad a backing vocal line; it's catchy!"
      - "Supposedly these ladies sued George Harrison for stealing this song for one of his own in 1970 (foreshadowing another #1 hit)"
  - title: I Will Follow Him
    artist: Little Peggy March
    notes:
      - I like the vocal rhythm; it reminds me of "New Killer Star" by David Bowie
      - Not half-bad vocal performace overall; but the male backing sound like a caveman singing
  - title: If You Wanna Be Happy
    artist: Jimmy Soul
    notes:
      - A doo-wop song that's rhythmically driven by the vocals; I like it
      - Almost like a rap song kind of with this cadence
      - The falsetto at the end is a bit grading on the ears
  - title: It's My Party
    artist: Lesley Gore
    notes:
      - Literally "It's my mental breakdown, and I get to choose the music!" The Song
      - Despite it being pretty standard, I like the "in-your-face" attitude the song's got
  - title: Sukiyaki
    artist: Kyu Sakamoto
    notes:
      - "First and only song sung in Japanese to reach #1"
      - Despite being in a different language, I feel like this guy is being more genuine than any of the other pop songs so far
      - Honest-to-God whistling solo
  - title: Easier Said Than Done
    artist: The Essex
    notes:
      - Well performed and the production quality is top-notch
      - Nice & upbeat
  - title: Surf City
    artist: Jan & Dean
    notes:
      - 'First """"Beach Boys"""" song to reach #1'
      - The "two girls for every boy" line is silly as hell
  - title: So Much Love
    artist: The Tymes
    notes:
      - A doo-wop song with a distinct "finger-snap/wood block" rhythm
      - Not much top say; standard love song
  - title: Fingertips Pt. 2
    artist: Little Steve Wonder
    notes:
      - Live performace from a 12-year Stevie Wonder
      - I'm absolutely amazed at how he has the whole crowd pumped up the whole time
      - It's hard to believe that he was this talented at such a young age
  - title: My Boyfriend's Back
    artist: The Angels
    notes:
      - Such a silly song; "My boyfriend's gonna kick your ass!"
      - It's tongue-in-cheek though, so it's ironic enough to enjoy
  - title: Blue Velvet
    artist: Bobby Vinton
    notes:
      - Probably the best Bobby Vinton song so far
      - It's just plainly better in terms of composition and performance
      - However, it's still fairly standard
  - title: Sugar Shack
    artist: Jimmy Glimer & The Fireballs
    notes:
      - I'm pretty sure this song is poking fun of Beatniks
      - It's like a pre-cursor to "Love Shack" by the B-52s
      - Silly, but nonetheless neat early garage rock song
  - title: Deep Purple
    artist: Nino Tempo & April Stevens
    notes:
      - Neat little folk song with a Harmonica
      - Very relaxing to listen to
  - title: I'm Leaving It Up to You
    artist: Dale & Grace
    notes:
      - Not too bad; but not too special
      - The duet vocals are pretty decent
  - title: Dominique
    artist: The Singing Nun
    notes:
      - "First song sung in French to reach #1"
      - Neat little folk song; the kind of thing you'd hear at Sunday School
