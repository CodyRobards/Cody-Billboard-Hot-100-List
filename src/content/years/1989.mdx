year: 1989
numberOnes:
  - title: Every Rose Has Its Thorn
    artist: Poison
    notes:
      - Glam rock/Acoustic power ballad
      - "It's cool that even in 1988, a solid open-chord guitar song can reach #1"
      - It's not too bad; Solid songwriting from Poison
  - title: My Prerogative
    artist: Bobby Brown
    notes:
      - "The first \"New Jack Swing\" song to reach #1; a sub-genre of R&B that was big in the '90s"
      - I love the "mind your own damn business" attitude of the song; Hell yeah! Tell 'em what for!
      - The main synth riff is just too damn funky; plue that percussion section is top-notch
      - I feel like this is the natural continuation of the kind of Funk and R&B that Stevie Wonder did in the '70s; I like it!
  - title: Two Hearts
    artist: Phil Collins
    notes:
      - Another single written for the film "Buster"
      - An upbeat pop song; similar to the style of pop from the early Motown era
      - Fantastic songwriting and composition; not to mention Collin's fantastic vocal performance
      - Just a solid pop song; doesn't drags on and doesn't feel forced
  - title: When I'm With You
    artist: Sheriff
    notes:
      - Power ballad; originally recorded in 1982, but re-released in 1988
      - It's okay I guess; it kind of drags on and doesn't have much going for it
  - title: Straight Up
    artist: Paula Abdul
    notes:
      - New Jack Swing song
      - Extremely upbeat; I really love those little flourishes on the synth throughout the song
      - I do think the little electric flute thing at the end is kinda cheesy; but it could be worse
  - title: Lost in Your Eyes
    artist: Debbie Gibson
    notes:
      - Piano ballad
      - It's an okay song; I will say that I'm impressed by the songwriting. She was only 18-years-old, ands she wrote and composed the whole song!
  - title: The Living Years
    artist: Mike + The Mechanics
    notes:
      - "Wow, another Genesis member with a solo career #1 hit!"
      - Soft rock ballad about a son regretting not having a good relationship with his now deceased father
      - It's neat seeing the prog rock influence in how Mick Rutherford writes a song, but there really isn't anything special about this song. I will say it's better than most othe ballads, but it can only go so far with it
  - title: Eternal Flame
    artist: The Bangles
    notes:
      - Minimal soft rock ballad
      - It's not half-bad; Well composed and performed. Can't say it's amazing or anything, but it's a nice song to listen to
  - title: The Look
    artist: Roxette
    notes:
      - Upbeat pop rock song; very guitar driven
      - I really love that rhythm-section; the bass and drums work together so well
      - I really how rhythmic the vocals are on the verses; it really helps drive the song along that rhythm-section
      - Also that "na, na, na, na, na!" section is really catchy! Especially when it stops for a second before going back into it!
  - title: She Drive Me Crazy
    artist: Fine Young Cannibals
    notes:
      - Upbeat pop rock song
      - I really love that Drop-D guitar tuning; really makes this song sound heavy
      - I actually like the high falsetto on the vocals; really suits the song well
      - That slinky guitar in the middle of the song is so damn funky!
  - title: Like a Prayer
    artist: Madonna
    notes:
      - Another upbeat pop rock song; this one's go a bit of a religious feel to it
      - It's hard to hate the church organ and choir in the back of the mix; I've always like the sound of those
      - The chorus is also pretty catchy as well
      - Nice little minor-key breakdown in the middle
  - title: I'll Be There For You
    artist: Bon Jovi
    notes:
      - Power ballad; this one's got a sitar!
      - I like the breadth of instrumentation in this song; really livens-up the song to be more than just a standard power ballad
      - Solid composition and performance from all involved
  - title: Forever Your Girl
    artist: Paula Abdul
    notes:
      - Upbeat synthpop song
      - What's up with that sax? It barrels into the song like a dump truck through drywall!
      - It's not a half-bad pop song; It's pleasant to listen to, but it's nothing too special
  - title: Rock On
    artist: Michael Damian
    notes:
      - Cover of am old glam rock song from 1973; originally written by David Essex
      - Nice guitar work in the middle and towards the end
      - It's a solid cover, but I like the original better
  - title: Wind Beneath My Wings
    artist: Bette Midler
    notes:
      - Slow ballad; recorded for the film "Beaches" starring Bette Midler
      - It's not half-bad; solid composition and performance. I really don't know why it has the legacy it does
  - title: I'll Be Loving You (Forever)
    artist: New Kids on the Block
    notes:
      - "Oh boy, here we go. First boy band #1 hit song!"
      - This one's a slow love ballad; and it's really not that great. There's hardly any passion in any of the performances, and it kind of drags on for over 4 minutes
  - title: Satisfied
    artist: Richard Marx
    notes:
      - Upbeat dance rock song
      - Solid guitar work on this song; suits the song well
      - Great chorus; very catchy
  - title: Baby Don't Forget My Number
    artist: Milli Vanilli
    notes:
      - Everybody's fake German vocal group; but let's put that aside and judge the song for what it is
      - It's nice and upbeat; very cheery
      - The rap-vocals are kinda cheesy; wish they took a more serious approach to the vocals
      - It's okay; I can't hate it
  - title: Good Thing
    artist: Fine Young Cannibals
    notes:
      - Boogie-woogie song
      - I really love that guitar intro; so abrupt as to say "Hey! listen to this song!"
      - Great chorus; kind of singable too!
      - That boogie-woogie piano solo in the middle is just fantastic
  - title: If You Don't Know Me by Now
    artist: Simply Red
    notes:
      - Cover of the Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes song from 1972
      - I actually like this better than the original; I like how stripped-down the song is with very little instrumentation. Let's the vocals stand out better
      - Solid vocal performance; can't complain
  - title: Toy Soldiers
    artist: Martika
    notes:
      - Soft rock ballad; sampled in the 2005 Eminem song "Like Toy Soldiers"
      - I really like that chorus; it's so powerful, but I can't say the verses are that great though
      - Not a half-bad guitar solo in the middle
  - title: Batdance
    artist: Prince
    notes:
      - Written for the Tim Burton film "Batman"
      - "This is the single weirdiest pop song I've heard reach #1; It's like one big experimental song that doesn't have any verses, choruses, or bridges. It's just kind of a Frankenstein's monster of riffs and samples from the film"
      - I will say that it is insane funky, every little guitar bit is just so well done
      - Okay, this has probably Prince's best guitar solo; It's so friggin heavy and gritty
      - The middle section has this mid-tempo, slinky funk guitar. It's so good
      - I will say the film samples are pretty forced into the song; doesn't really work that well
  - title: Right Here Waiting
    artist: Richard Marx
    notes:
      - Soft rock piano ballad
      - Nice to see some classical guitar in a pop song; very underrated insturment
      - It's not a half-bad piano ballad; can't say it's anything too special
  - title: Cold Hearted
    artist: Paula Abdul
    notes:
      - Another upbeat New Jack Swing song
      - This one's okay; it's catchy enough, but there's not much else to it
  - title: Hangin' Tough
    artist: New Kids on the Block
    notes:
      - There's just something funny about listening to some teeny boppers try and sound tough
      - The rap vocals just can't help but sound tacky
      - I will say that it is well-composed; They really tried their best to make the instrumentation sound "tough"
      - Not a half-bad guitar solo in the middle
  - title: Don't Wanna Lose You
    artist: Gloria Estefan
    notes:
      - Slow ballad
      - It's not bad, but it's just kinda "meh"; not much else to say about this one
  - title: Girl I'm Gonna Miss You
    artist: Milli Vanilli
    notes:
      - Smoooooth ballad
      - Another case of cheesy rap lyrics; they really just can't help themselves can they?
      - The chorus is kinda bland; I guess they tried to add some backing vocals, but it's really not all that great
      - I will give credit to the fact that they used an honest-to-God clarinet in the song!
  - title: Miss You Much
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - Man, we really are missing people a lot these last few weeks, eh?
      - Okay, this one's kinda gritty; the percussion and sampling sounds like an industrial zone
      - That grittinest carries into the vocals during the chorus; amazing!
      - This is probably the heaviest you can get with a standard pop song; I'm impressed that Jackson was willing to push into that direction!
  - title: Listen to Your Heart
    artist: Roxette
    notes:
      - Power ballad
      - Not half-bad; well composed and sounds better than most power ballads we've heard so far
      - There's even a decent guitar solo in the middle!
      - Wow, a key-change that isn't just up a half-step! and it sounds really natural!
  - title: When I See You Smile
    artist: Bad English
    notes:
      - Glam metal power ballad; lead vocals by John Waite
      - Not too bad of a guitar solo
      - It's got a decent chorus and Waite's vocals are decent also; can't say much else about the song
  - title: Blame It on the Rain
    artist: Milli Vanilli
    notes:
      - I will this one's a lot more catchy and upbeat then the other hits they've had so far
      - This one's actually not half-bad; It doesn't have any forced rap vocals and everyone's performace is good
  - title: We Didn't Start the Fire
    artist: Billy Joel
    notes:
      - This is quite an interesting song; it basically chronicles a whole bunch of world events from 1949 to 1989 with each lyric; very clever!
      - The cadence of the verse lyrics are just soooo good!
      - Also that chorus is really damn catchy! "We didn't start the fire! It was always burnin' since the world's been turnin'!"
  - title: Another Day in Paradise
    artist: Phil Collins
    notes:
      - "The final #1 hit of the '80s, can Phil Collins deliver?"
      - "...yes he can! This is probably his best #1 hit song; it's a song about the homeless, and he knocks it out of the park"
      - The spooky intro with that reverberated snare is just perfect
      - That laid back rhythm with those synth leads are amazing; real sets the mood for the song
      - I really like those subtle acoustic guitar bits throughout; so nice to listen to
