commentary: An alright last year for the '00s decade; can't say much either than that I'm disappointed that the production quality went from decent, to bad, to really good, to horrible in the span of just 10 years. You'd think by the time we got to the iPhone, 1080p, digital streaming part of the decade, the quality of the music would be better, but it just really isn't there. However, I'm still hopeful of the 2010s. I do remember liking some of the stuff that came out during my last two years of High School, and even some of the stuff that came out while I was working and going to College. I can only hope that I can finish this project feeling like It ended on a high note, so let's go!
year: 2009
numberOnes:
  - title: Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)
    artist: Beyoncé
    notes:
      - "\"Yo, Taylor... I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the BEST music videos of ALL TIME!\" said Kayne West during one of his manic episodes at the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards"
      - It's great to hear another fantastic vocal performace by Beyoncé, but unfortunately this song suffers from an over-bearing and noisey production
  - title: Just Dance
    artist: Lady Gaga feat. Colby O'Donis
    notes:
      - Electro-pop song; heavy use of synths
      - I really like that main synth line; so mezmerizing
      - Gaga's voice suits the song very well; kind of reminds me of Cher
      - Actually, I think all of the synths are top-notch!
      - O'Donis' verse isn't half-bad either
      - That little breakdown in the middle is great; the two vocal lines going at the same time was a great creative decision
  - title: My Life Would Suck Without You
    artist: Kelly Clarkson
    notes:
      - I kind of like the clean electric-guitar riff that plays throughout
      - Can't say I like the chorus; it's so loud and over-produced
      - Clarkson's voice is pretty decent here, but the rest of the song is pretty forgetable
  - title: Crack a Bottle
    artist: Eminem feat. Dr. Dre & 50 Cent
    notes:
      - The boxing announcer intro is pretty funny; Eminem is rapping as his "alter-ego", Slim Shady on this one
      - The chorus is kinda lame and sounds like it would better fit in a 'N Sync song barring the lyrics
      - Dr. Dre and 50 Cent's verses aren't half-bad, but it really can't make up for the boring production
  - title: Right Round
    artist: Flo Rida feat. Kesha
    notes:
      - Rap song; samples Dead Or Alive's massive '80s hit song, "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"
      - I remember hearing this song for the first at the end credits to the film "The Hangover"
      - The chorus isn't really anything special, it's basically the same as the song that it samples; might as well listen to the original in that case
      - Flo Rida's triplet flow is pretty solid on this one; besides that, it's a pretty tacky and plastic-sounding song
  - title: Poker Face
    artist: Lady Gaga
    notes:
      - "Another Electropop #1 hit by Lady Gaga"
      - The poker references in the lyrics are pretty clever, I must say
      - Another great vocal performace by Gaga; also very catchy chorus
      - I can't hide this; the "Puh puh puh poker face puh puh poker face" line is absurdly cheesy
  - title: Boom Boom Pow
    artist: The Black Eyed Peas
    notes:
      - "Massive hit; #1 for 12 consectutive weeks"
      - Suprisingly minimal; just a simple 808 beat and some eerie synths
      - The lyrics are straight-up club trash, but I don't know if I can really demean the song for that... it's literally a club song
      - The breakdown is pretty damn good
  - title: I Gotta Feeling
    artist: The Black Eyed Peas
    notes:
      - "ANOTHER massive hit by The Black Eyed Peas. This time at #1 for 14 consectutive weeks, making them have the longest streak at #1 for a group at 26 weeks!"
      - This one's more upbeat and cheery; the lyrics are also pretty postive
      - "Another mindless club song, but unlike their last #1 hit, this one's got some lazy lyrics and is over-produced to hell and back"
  - title: Down
    artist: Jay Sean feat. Lil' Wayne
    notes:
      - Electro-pop song; uses some string synths for it's main progession
      - It's like listening to a dollar-store Justin Timberlake. I mean, his voice sounds good and all, bit I can't help but picture Timberlake in my head
      - How the hell did Lil' Wayne even have a career? This dude is hot garbage; can't write a rap verse worth a shit, and the gimmick of throwing a warbly autotune over his voice wears thin IMMEDIATELY
  - title: "3"
    artist: Britney Spears
    notes:
      - Educational electro-pop song; teaches the listener how to count to 3
      - In all seriousness, it's a pretty bog-standard song for the genre; I'm just glad that it has a decent production. It's mixed well and Spear's voice is pretty good on this one
  - title: Fireflies
    artist: Owl City
    notes:
      - Alt rock/Synth-pop song; I remember how every CGI-animated film around this time used this band's music for every montage and ending credits roll, but I somehow managed to not hear this one song until MANY YEARS later
      - The main synth line is pretty quirky and neat
      - The vocoder vocals is pretty neat too; reminds me of Daft Punk
      - Another case of really silly lyrics, but I guess they fit the song well enough
  - title: Whatcha Say
    artist: Jason Derulo
    notes:
      - R&B song; samples the 2005 song "Hide and Seek" by Imogen Heap
      - Another case of "uncanny valley" use of autotune; they probably should have just went all the way with it like T-Pain on this one
      - Really forgetable; indistinguishable from many songs from the time
  - title: Empire State of Mind
    artist: Jay-Z feat. Alicia Keys
    notes:
      - "Hip hop song about New York City and the last #1 hit of the '00s decade; can Jay-Z finish these past 10 years strong?"
      - I think he can. This song was made for a rapper like him; his lyrics and flow are really on point here
      - Wow, that chorus is soooo good! Keys' voice carries the song like how Atlas carries the earth
      - The sample choice of "Love on a Two-Way Street" by The Moments was genius; really suits the vibe of the song so well here
