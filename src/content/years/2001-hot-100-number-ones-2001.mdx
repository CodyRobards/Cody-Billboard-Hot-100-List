    title: Independent Women Pt. 1
    artist: Destiny's Child
    notes:
      - R&B Song featured in the "Charlie's Angels" movie re-boot
      - I like this one, there's a real "attitude" present in their performances, and they are large and in-charge here
      - Great chorus; very catchy and well-done
      - The church choir section is great; good creative decision
  - position: 2
    title: It Wasn't Me
    artist: Shaggy feat. Ricardo 'Rikrok' Ducent
    notes:
      - Reggae song about infidelity
      - Solid groove; I especially love the use of the 12-string acoustic guitar!
      - Shaggy's patois flow is on-point here, and Rikrok's voice is really good here
      - The lyrics are absolutely hilarious; it's clearly tongue-in-cheek
  - position: 3
    title: Ms. Jackson
    artist: Outkast
    notes:
      - Alternative hip hop song
      - I really love that reversed beat; very unique
      - Very catchy chorus; "oooooh! I am for real!"
      - The "forever... forever? forever ever?!" line is so great
      - The flows are pretty good; it's kind of staggered, but it works well here
  - position: 4
    title: Stutter (Double Take Remix)
    artist: Joe feat. Mystikal
    notes:
      - R&B song remix featured in the film "Double Take"
      - The performace is pretty solid here, I'm partial against the "stuttering" gimmick however
      - The Mystikal verse is probably the single most aggressive vocal performance I've heard so far; I like it!
      - I wish I could like it more, but it is kinda just "okay" overall
  - position: 5
    title: Butterfly
    artist: Crazy Town
    notes:
      - Rap song... or is this a nu-metal song? It samples a Red Hot Chili Peppers song, so I guess it's rock technically
      - Solid flows and fairly catchy, but the lyrics are low-effort I think
      - The vocal performance is alright; it's really missing the power a song like this should have
  - position: 6
    title: Angel
    artist: Shaggy feat. Rayvon
    notes:
      - 'Reggae song; samples the former #1 "The Joker" by Steve Miller Band and borrows the chorus from the Chip Taylor-written song "Angel In The Morning"'
      - Once again, a good blend of smooth R&B vocals from the feature, and good patois rap verses by Shaggy
  - position: 7
    title: All For You
    artist: Janet Jackson
    notes:
      - Dance-pop song; samples the main riff from "The Glow of Love" by Change
      - It's well-performed and produced, but the song is largely forgettable; it really just ticks the boxes of the genre, and nothing else
  - position: 8
    title: Lady Marmalade
    artist: Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mýa & Pink
    notes:
      - 'Cover of the former #1 hit; originally performed by Labelle. This one was recorded for the soundtrack for the film "Moulin Rouge"'
      - It's a faithful cover for the most part, but it's really nothing special. Besides the rap verse from Lil' Kim, it lacks any real creative direction
  - position: 9
    title: U Remind Me
    artist: Usher
    notes:
      - Smooth mid-tempo R&B song
      - Very solid vocal performace from Usher; especially during that chorus
      - It's not a half-bad song, but it's really nothing too special
  - position: 10
    title: Bootylicious
    artist: Destiny's Child
    notes:
      - Oh shit, this song samples the main guitar riff from "Edge of Seventeen" by Stevie Nicks!
      - Great vocal cadence from all involved
      - Good chorus; very catchy
      - As great as the sample is, it just drones on for the whole song; no really creative use of it honestly
  - position: 11
    title: Fallin'
    artist: Alica Keys
    notes:
      - Neo-soul song; very piano-driven song with a minimalistic beat
      - Great vocal performace by Keys, suits the song very well
      - Haunting vocal harmonies towards the end; very cool
      - Very faithful to '60s soul music; very qualified to carry the torch
  - position: 12
    title: I'm Real (Murder Mix)
    artist: Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule
    notes:
      - 'Hip hop song; was #1 during the 9/11 attacks, kinda eerie that the "murder" mix was what went #1'
      - Ja Rule really steals the show here; his voice carries the song, and makes Lopez's vocals feel like backing vocals
      - Solid beat behind the song; a head-bopper for sure
      - Great chorus; very catchy
  - position: 13
    title: Family Affair
    artist: Mary J. Blige
    notes:
      - Solid production by Dr. Dre here; hell, even the beat sounds like it would be a Dr. Dre song
      - Great vocal performace by Blige, here flows are good and here voice sounds real good here
      - Very catchy chorus
      - If it wasn't for Blige's performance, it would be a fairly standard R&B song
  - position: 14
    title: U Got It Bad
    artist: Usher
    notes:
      - Slow R&B song; acoustic guitar driven
      - I guess someone had to carry the torch of slow R&B after Boyz II Men left the scene; can't say I enjoy this too much but it's well-done for what it's worth
      - Neat guitar solo outro though
  - position: 15
    title: How You Remind Me
    artist: Nickelback
    notes:
      - "This was probably the last straight-up rock song to reach #1, and it's no surprise to me that it's a Nickelback song"
      - "My first real clear memory of a song at 6-years-old; I remember how one week, this song didn't exist, and then the next week it was EVERYWHERE. On the radio, on burnt-CDs, at grocery stores, it was insane how this one blew up and according to Neilsen Soundscan, this was the #1 song of the decade in terms radioplay for the '00s decade"
      - Solid guitar driven song; a lot more distortion focused and it's in Drop D tuning!
      - The vocals are decent; can't say I like Chad Kroger's voice, but it fits the style well enough
      - The chorus is good; and I like the quiet middle-section as well
  - position: 1
