commentary: Now THIS was a good year. Probably the first good year. This is when the quality of pop music started to get much better across the board. Only one song I would say is not good (Leader of the Pack) and the rest are great or at least good.

    title: Leader Of The Pack
    artist: The Shangri-Las
    notes:
      - It's like the doo-wop era didn't want to die...
      - The opening line and title lyric (with motorcyle reving for good measure) are really cheesy
      - The instrumentation is really muddy
      - The little spoken-word sections stop the song dead in it's track
  - position: 20
    title: Ringo
    artist: Lorne Greene
    notes:
      - Song about a gunslinger
      - It's like listening to a Louis L'amour audio book
      - The instrumentation is repetitive along with the "Ringooooooo" caveman backing vocal
      - Not a bad song, but feels incomplete without the rest of the audiobook(?)
  - position: 21

    artist: Bobby Vinton
    notes:
      - Finally, Vinton in top form
      - Best vocal performance overall by Vinton
