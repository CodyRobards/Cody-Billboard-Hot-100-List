commentary: Another "meh" year; this time we got some real lame songs this year, but we also got some really good ones this year too so I guess it just kinda balances out. At this point, I guess artists for this decade started to coast on their success with some easy lay-up songs.
year: 2017
numberOnes:
  - title: Starboy
    artist: The Weeknd feat. Daft Punk
    notes:
      - Of course the beat is amazing; it's made by Daft Punk!
      - Solid vocal performance by The Weeknd; great vocal cadence and control
      - That chorus is so Daft Punk; those vocoder vocals are iconic as hell
  - title: Black Beatles
    artist: Rae Sremmurd feat. Gucci Mane
    notes:
      - Trap rap song
      - It's got a decent beat; mezmerizing
      - I really can't say the Beatles comparisons are that great; I don't think these guys know much about them
      - Mane's verse is just funny as hell to listen to; it's like he has no care in the world
      - Well, I guess they've at least heard "Daytripper" at least once, since they borrow a lyric from that song
  - title: Bad and Boujee
    artist: Migos feat. Lil' Uzi Vert
    notes:
      - Trap rap song
      - Solid triplet flows from Offset and the Scottish Snaps by Quavo are pretty good too
      - Great hype man; "woo woo!" "brraaaappp!" "skrrrrtt!"
      - Uzi Vert's verse is a little too silly; seems a bit out of place
      - It's basically a much better version of "Panda" by Desiigner
  - title: Shape Of You
    artist: Ed Sheeran
    notes:
      - Pop song; has a dancehall feel to it
      - The main beat is pretty solid; I like the muted guitar scratches
      - Great vocal performance by Sheeran; not half-bad lyrics either
      - Just a very well-composed pop song all around
  - title: Humble
    artist: Kendrick Lamar
    notes:
      - That beat is so damn good; the bass piano notes that drive it were a great idea
      - The vocal acrobatics by Lamar are just insane; he's bouncing all over the place here; quite impressive
      - 'This is probably the most profane song to hit #1; I think the word "bitch" is said more than any other word in the chorus... I love it!'
  - title: That's What I Like
    artist: Bruno Mars
    notes:
      - Another throwback song; this time I think Mars is going for a '90s R&B sound here
      - Fantastic vocal performance by Mars; great cadence and control throughout
      - That chorus is really good; very catchy
      - Honestly, he's done it again; Another case of making the "perfect" song from an older era of music
  - title: I'm The One
    artist: DJ Khaled feat. Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper & Lil' Wayne
    notes:
      - "This is probably the most features I've seen so far for a #1 hit song... OH GOD Lil' Wayne is back"
      - "\"Anotha one!\" I friggin love Khaled; I don't think he realizes how much of a meme he's become"
      - Despite all of these collaborators, they couldn't throw together a verse that doesn't make them look like complete clowns
      - This upbeat, cheery beat just feels really out of place with these lyrics
      - I will say this is probably Lil' Wayne's best performance so far... which is saying it's just "bad" and not "terrible"
  - title: Despacito (Remix)
    artist: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee feat. Justin Bieber
    notes:
      - Latin Pop song; sung in Spanish mostly
      - "Okay WOW. This one manage to tie Boyz II Men & Mariah Carey's \"One Sweet Day\" for long-running #1 single; going 16 weeks straight! Does it stack up?"
      - Meh, can't say it does. It's catchy, but it really lacks the "oompf" other juggernauts
      - Both Bieber and Fonsi's verses are just so plain and boring; Daddy Yankee's verse has more of an edge to it, but that's about it
      - I put it on the shelf with Ricky Martin's "Livin' la Vida Loca" for being too boring for a Latin song
  - title: Look What You Made Me Do
    artist: Taylor Swift
    notes:
      - Electro-pop dance song
      - Okay, that chorus is just terrible; it's ashame since everything else is okay
      - It's like a lamer version "I'm Too Sexy" by Right Said Fred
  - title: Bodak Yellow
    artist: Cardi B
    notes:
      - "Our first female rapper to score a trap rap #1 hit"
      - Her flow is pretty solid but her voice is just annoying here, can't say much else
  - title: Rockstar
    artist: Post Malone feat. 21 Savage
    notes:
      - Another trap rap song; this one's in the sub-sub-genre of "cloud" rap
      - Malone's verses are a bit too plain, but the middle part where he sings a bit is quite nice
      - 21 Savage's verse is probably the best part of the song
  - title: Perfect
    artist: Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé
    notes:
      - Acoustic pop love song
      - Sheeran's voice is good; not crazy amazing, but still good
      - The chorus is pretty solid; not half-bad
      - Beyoncé is the best part of the song; she really cares that second and final verse
