commentary: |
  The 1980s opened the door for synthesizers and drum machines to become chart staples. Acts like Depeche Mode
  and a-ha brought futuristic textures to pop, while Prince blurred genre lines with virtuosic production. The
  experimental energy of the era planted the seeds for the remix culture that would flourish in the 1990s.
