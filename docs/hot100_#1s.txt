1958
----

1. "Poor Little Fool" - Ricky Nelson

	- Classic country song and first #1 ever on the Hot 100
	- Kinda reminds me of an upbeat version of "Hallejulah" by Leneord Cohen
	
2. "Volare (Nel blu dipinto di blu)" - Domenico Modugno
	
	- Pop/Swing song sung in Italian
	- Very well composed
	- Very hoppy/bouncy and cheerful
	
3. "Little Star" - The Elegants

	- Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in a doo-wop style w/ some original lyrics
	- Vocals drown out the whole mix; poorly mixed overall
	
4. "It's All In The Game" - Tommy Edwards

	- Co-written by the former VPOTUS of Calvin Coolidge Administration? WHAT?
	- Standard love song; nothing too special, but background vocals are pretty good and mezmerizing!
	
5. "It's Only Make Believe" - Conway Twitty

	- Twitty's vocals are good and powerful; great singer
	- I love the rising vocals to the chorus line
	
6. "Tom Dooley" - The Kingston Trio

	- Banjo/Guitar Folk song
	- Has a vocal prelude to the story of Tom Dooley
	- Great Chorus; would be a great song to sing at a summer camp around a campfire!
	
7. "To Know Him Is to Love Him" - The Teddy Bears
	
	- First female singer/group to reach #1 on the Hot 100
	- Kinda boring and slow overall, but the bridge is pretty good
	
8. "The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) - The Chimpmunks with David Seville

	- Standard song on your Christmas party playlist
	- Kind of a neat novelty song; but the gag wears out quickly

This year had a nice bit of varity; surprised it wasn't all just doo-wop. Amongst all of the American artists, The Italian song Volaire blew them all out the water for me. Rick Nelson's a distant 2nd on this list! Ha!

1959
----

1. "The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) - The Chimpmunks with David Seville

	- People still listen to Christmas music in January?
	
2. "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" - The Platters

	- Standard doo-woop love song; very pleasant
	- Good lead vocals, but nothing too special
	- Strong finish
	
3. "Stagger Lee" - Lloyd Price

	- Nice upbeat R&B song; very catchy
	- Good instrument performaces and good vocals from Price.
	
4. "Venus" - Frankie Avalon

	- Very dreamy, but the vocals have wayyy to much reverb
	- Background vocals are surprisingly haunting during the verses; very nice!
	
5. "Come Softly to Me" - The Fleetwoods

	- Very Do-woppy vocal song
	- Very intimate performance (considering the title), but they sing as if you were a foot away from them their faces.
	
6. "The Happy Organ" - Dave "Baby" Cortez

	- Electric Organ Instrumental song, probably the first electronic song to reach #1
	- Organ sounds good, but the guitar solo is very muddy and overly-reverbed; can't tell what's going on, AAAAAAAAA

7. "Kansas City" - Wilbert Harrison

	- Sounds like what you would get if you randomly-generated a '50s Rock song on your computer
	- Vocals are very nasally; not my cup of tea
	
8. "The Battle of New Orleans" - Johnny Horton

	- Classic folk song!
	- Very creative(and funny) way to give a history lesson and very singable!
	
9. "Lonely Boy" - Paul Anka

	- Sounds kind of like a proto-Beatles song; maybe Anka was an inspiration to them?
	- The bit after each chorus is kind of neat
	
10. "A Bing Hunk o' Love" - Elvis Presley

	- First Elvis song to reach #1 on the Hot 100
	- If there ever was a '50s rock star who was the best at the game, it was the King!
	- Instrumentation and vocals are leagues above anything else so far
	- Almost sounds like a punk song honestly

11. "The Three Bells" - The Browns

	- Vocal driven song
	- Pauses each verse to slow down and sing a bit; kind of distracting
	- Vocals are a little too plain and boring
	
12. "Sleepwalk" - Santo & Johnny

	- Slide-Guitar Instrumental
	- Absolutely amazing; perfectly personifies what being in a dream is like
	- Lots of emotion packed into a few instruments
	
13. "Mack the Knife" - Bobby Darin

	- Traditional Pop/Swing song; in the same vein as the Rat Pack
	- Very well composed and very catchy!
	- Definitely the kind of song to put you in a good mood

14. "Mr. Blue" - The Fleetwoods

	- A little better then the other Fleetwoods song earlier in the year
	- The "Mr. Blue" refrain is quite nice to listen to
	
15. "Heartaches by the Number" - Guy Mitchell

	- I may be heavly biased in saying this song is great; it's off of the soundtrack for Fallout: New Vegas, the greatest game of all time
	- The chorus is quite memorable and each verse builds off the last one quite well
	
16. "Why" - Frankie Avalon

	- The harp-like guitar chords suite the song very well
	- The female vocals in the last half are kinda of plain

Once again, a nice bit of varity this year. Can't say it was an amazing year, but it was a decent one.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1960
----

1. "El Paso" - Marty Robbins

	- Marty Robbins was not only a good singer, but an excellent story-teller
	- The Tex-Mex sound is extremely on-point for this story
	- Amazing vocal performance by everyone involved
	- Absolutely engaging story; it's almost like reading a Louis L'amour novel

2. "Running Bear" - Johnny Preston

	- Story about a Native American
	- The "uga-uga" backing vocals are a little too tacky for this novelty song; no way this would pass today

3. "Teen Angel" - Mark Dinning
	
	- An extremely mopey song about a HS student dying in an car accident
	- Feels really insincere for such a heavy topic
	
4. "Theme from a Summer Place" - Percy Faith

	- Theme to romantic film "A Summer Place"
	- Very well composed; instrumentation is on point
	- Strings are a little too piercing on the ears though
	
5. "Stuck on You" - Elvis Presley

	- Clever song lyrics, I must say
	- Elvis' vocal performance is great; not much else to say
	
6. "Cathy's Clown" - The Everly Brothers
	
	- The dual-vocals are very impressive; kind of like a proto-Simon & Garfunkel
	- Drums are great on this one
	
7. "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" - Connie Francis

	- Francis is a good singer, but a little too piercing for my taste (at least on this one)
	- Overall, a pretty standard song of the era
	
8. "Alley Oop" - The Hollywood Argyles

	- Song about the Newspaper comic
	- Same tacky novelty of The Chipmunks and wears out quickly
	
9. "I'm Sorry" - Brenda Lee

	- Amazing vocal performance from Lee; very strong
	- Very pleasant string bits here and there; not overdone at all
	
10. "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini" - Brian Hyland

	- Absolutely dumb novelty song, but completely self-aware to the point that it becomes great
	
11. "It's Now of Never" - Elvis Presley

	- Sounds like Elvis is trying to impersonate a ghost, but even then it still sounds great
	- Sometimes a song is so well written that it makes up for it's flaws
	
12. "The Twist" - Chubby Checker
	
	- Finally some damn R&B this year...
	- ...and it's infectiously catchy, how can you not like this song?!
	- Sax solos are not to be rejected
	
13. "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" - Connie Francis

	- The stacked vocal tracks help make her vocals haunting in a way
	- The trumpet is a nice touch in between lines
	
14. "Mr. Custer" - Larry Verne

	- This is like a dollar-store version of Johnny Horton, telling the story of The Battle of the Little Bighorn
	- Unlike Johnny Horton, the vocal performance here is absolutely obnoxious
	- Even in 1960, your average American was equally capable of picking the weirdest damn thing to send to the top of the charts
	- I still can't believe this was a #1 hit...
	
15. "Save the Last Dance for Me" - The Drifters

	- The Drifters were clearly one of the better R&B groups of the era, and it shows here
	- The triangle driving the rhythm section is a little tacky but not to distracing
	- The Strings in the middle are a great addition

16. "I Want to Be Wanted" - Brenda Lee

	- Amazing vocals by Lee as always
	- The lyrics however make here come off as desperate and clingy
	
17. "Georgia on My Mind" - Ray Charles

	- A song to stand the test of time; an amazing ambassador for the Peach State
	- Very somber and emotional
	- Ever sadder when you consider that Georgia was the last place Ray saw before he went blind at age 7
	
18. "Stay" - Maurice Williams & The Zodiacs

	- Somehow it took this long in the year for a doo-wop song to top the charts
	- Honestly, it's probably he best one I've heard so far
	- The "Stay!" stabs from the backing vocals is kinda catchy
	
19. "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" - Elvis Presley

	- A nice and pleasent song from the King
	- Reminds me the Ink Spots, you can tell they were an influence on Elvis
	
OVERALL RANKING

17. "Running Bear" - Johnny Preston
18. "Teen Angel" - Mark Dinning
19. "Mr. Custer" - Larry Verne

Okay, this year was weird. It was either a silly novelty song or a legendary song; very little feel within the grey area on this one. However Marty Robbins and Ray Charles are Titans compared to the rest; really puts them to shame.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1961
----

1. "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" - Elvis Presley

	- A nice and pleasent song from the King
	- Reminds me the Ink Spots, you can tell they were an influence on Elvis
	
2. "Wonderland by Night" - Bert Kaempfert

	- Nice and slow Instrumental piece
	- The trumpet's a little over bearing at the start, but is good nonetheless
	
3. "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" - The Shirelles

	- All-female R&B singing group
	- Overall a pretty solid R&B Song, not much else to say

4. "Calcutta" - Lawrence Welk

	- Instrumental version of a German pop song
	- Organ and Accordions galore! Not too bad of a hook
	- The forced "la, la, la" in the background are kind of funny to listen to

5. "Pony Time" - Chubby Checker
	
	- It sounds like he tried to emulate "The Twist" but with different lyrics
	- Seems like a tamer version of "The Twist"; surprised people still bought it
	
6. "Surrender" - Elvis Presley

	- It sounds like the James Bond theme sung by Elvis
	- It's kind of neat to hear Elvis try a different style that he's not used to
	
7. "Blue Moon" - The Marcels

	- Easily the most overdone doo-wop version of Blue Moon I've ever heard
	- The backing vocals are so comically exagerated, that I can't tell if it's a joke or not

8. "Runaway" - Del Shannon

	- The oldest song I can remember being played on Kono 101.1FM when they used to be an oldies station years ago
	- The "why, why, why, why" lyric is impressive, but kind of sounds like the grown-ups from The Peanuts
	- The high-pitched Thermin(?) solo is a little jarring but kind of fits the song
	
9. "Mother-in-Law" - Ernie K-Doe

	- Funny song topic, but performed well enough
	- "Mother-in-Law" is repeated a little too often, kind of wish they had better filler lyrics
	
10. "Travelin' Man" - Ricky Nelson

	- Kind of a silly song, this guy gets around if you know what I mean...
	- An honest-to-god guitar solo, took long enough for a song to have one
	
11. "Running Scared" - Roy Orbison

	- The staggered marching cadence helps build up the song well
	- Roy sounds like he's the verge of tears... and I'm not knocking that
	
12. "Moody River" - Pat Boone

	- Almost sounds a '90s alt rock song with the chord progression
	- Can't say much else either than that it's performed well enough
	
13. "Quarter to Three" - Gary U.S. Bonds

	- Very catchy; A real good clap-along song
	- Half-decent Sax solo
	
14. "Tossin and Turnin" - Bobby Lewis

	- The doubled Sax/Trumpet solo is neat
	- An okay R&B song, no clue as to why it was #1 for 7 weeks straight but whatever

15. "Wooden Heart" - Joe Dowell

	- Well at least they tried to make the electric organ work with this song
	- Too simple of a rhythm section; I'm gonna fall asleep
	
16. "Michael" - The Highwaymen

	- An old African-American spiritual/work song
	- Done quite well, good vocals all around
	- Very soulful
	
17. "Take Good Care of My Baby" - Bobby Vee

	- Good vocal performance overall
	- Still kind of run-of-the-mill love song
	
18. "Hit the Road Jack" - Ray Charles

	- The "no more, no more, no more, no more" line is addicting
	- The decending bass line is just too good
	
19. "Runaround Sue" - Dion

	- Very catchy, clap-along song
	- Dion's "whoa" vocal is just great
	- Such a simple song that does so much
	
20. "Big Bad John" - Jimmy Dean

	- Story-telly song about a miner
	- It's kind of like a spoken-word/rap song... which is funny cause it's clearly a country song
	- Not too bad for a novelty song

21. "Please Mr. Postman" - The Marvelettes

	- Opening line is very singable
	- Standard doo-wop number
	
22. "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" - The Tokens

	- The lyric "Oh-weem-ah-wep" as silly as it sounds is very singable
	- The lead vocal is very good, despite sounding very silly
	- Great Tenor Sax solo in the middle

1. "Michael" - The Highwaymen

21. "Travelin' Man" - Ricky Nelson
22. "Blue Moon" - The Marcels

This year was quite lackluster honestly. Some good hits here and there, but a lot of "meh". Funny that the best song was an old slave work song

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1962
----

1. "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" - The Tokens

	- The lyric "Oh-weem-ah-wep" as silly as it sounds is very singable
	- The lead vocal is very good, despite sounding very silly
	- Great Tenor Sax solo in the middle
	
2. "The Twist" - Chubby Checker

	- Supposedly the dance craze came back just less than 2 years later and topped the chart again, amazing!
	- Literally the same song; not even re-recorded
	
3. "Peppermint Twist" - Joey Dee and the Starliters

	- Another fad "dance" song to challenge "The Twist" believe it or not
	- Completely mindless but I guess it's catchy
	
4. "Duke of Earl" - Gene Chandler

	- The "Duke of Earl" bass singer sounds so dopey
	- It really just feels like every doo-wop group was trying to write the same song at this time
	
5. "Hey! Baby" - Bruce Channel

	- Somehow this song lasted long enough in the public sub-concious for it to end up being played by my High School band at football games
	- It's not too bad; this is the first harmonic I've heard so far
	
6. "Don't Break the Heart That Loves You" - Connie Francis

	- Connie's is a good singer, but all of these songs of hers really do all sound the same
	- The spoken word section is fairly juvinille ("Don't break my heart like how a little child breaks a toy")

7. "Johnny Angel" - Shelley Fabares

	- "OMG isn't he just soooo dreamy? He's such a dreamboat!" The Song
	- I can only imagine this being good to teenage girls in 1962
	- It's so bubblegum I feel like I'm turning pink

8. "Good Luck Charm" - Elvis Presley

	- Has a nice country swing to it
	- The start-stop dynamic with the "come on and..." lyric is great
	- It's amazing how Elvis seems to rise above the rest in this era
	
9. "Soldier Boy" - The Shirelles

	- First song about the troops! I guess...
	- A little too boring and slow

10. "Stranger on the Shore" - Mr. Acker Bilk

	- First straight-Jazz piece to hit #1; Clarinet piece
	- The clarinet and strings play off each other well
	- Some people find the clarinet to be grading on the ears, but I think it sounds nice
	
11. "I Can't Stop Loving You" - Ray Charles

	- Ray sounds good, but the backing chorus feels out of place for a slow R&B song
	- Ray's piano really shines, even as it sits in the back of the mixed
	
12. "The Stripper" - David Rose
	
	- Jazz instrumental
	- I imagine this was the kind of music played in strip clubs back in the early '60s
	- Can't say I'm a big fan of the "strut your stuff" type of jazz here, but it's well composed
	
13. "Roses Are Red (My Love) - Bobby Vinton

	- Pure high school love story fluff
	- I do like how simple and minimal the song is, it knows what it is so it's doesn't go overboard
	
14. "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" - Neil Sedaka

	- Another over-bearing doo-wop song, it really plays up the sound to the point of it being comical
	- Seems obnoxiously insincere; made to sell records
	
15. "The Loco-Motion" - Little Eva

	- The "c'mon baby, do the locomotion!" refrain is catchy
	- Overall, it feels fresh in a genre that has sounded pretty similar across the board

16. "Sheila" - Tommy Roe

	- Tommy's voice sounds so goofy; it's a shame because he sings well enough
	- The drums seem to be doing some sort of "George of the Jungle" roll the whole song; very distracting

17. "Sherry" - The Four Seasons

	- First Four Seasons song to hit #1... really? this was your best America?
	- It's like they are doing a parody of a doo-wop group
	- It's a good song in of itself, but the performaces are so gussied up
	
18. "Monster Mash" - Bobby 'Boris' Pickett & the Crypt-Kickers

	- The Misfits do a pretty good cover of this song
	- THIS is how you do a novelty song; don't take yourself seriously!
	- Despite being clearly a doo-wop song, it's distinctly Halloween sounding in of itself
	
19. "He's a Rebel" - The Crystals

	- Standard Female R&B song
	- The chorus is actually quite unique and fun
	- Face-melting Sax solo
	
20. "Big Girls Don't Cry" - The Four Seasons

	- "Big girls don't Crrrryrryryryryyy!!!!" is insanely obnoxious
	- Im probably being too cruel to The Four Seasons and their talent, but it's hard to take them seriously
	
21. "Telstar" - The Tornados

	- Is this the first prog-rock instrumental?
	- The rhythm is really skittish; disorienting, but not in a fun way
	- It's sounds like a western set in space

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Stranger on the Shore" - Mr. Acker Bilk

18. "Big Girls Don't Cry" - The Four Seasons
19. "Johnny Angel" - Shelley Fabares
20. "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" - Neil Sedaka

Worst year so far. It's like the death throes of doo-wop and insincere cash-cows of the pre-British Invasion U.S. I'm surprised that the most enjoyable #1's this year were instrumentals, let alone a clarinet song being my most favorite.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1963
----

1. "Telstar" - The Tornados

	- Is this the first prog-rock instrumental?
	- The rhythm is really skittish; disorienting, but not in a fun way
	- It's sounds like a western set in space
	
2. "Go Away Little Girl" - Steve Lawrence
	
	- Yet another generic love song...
	- I will say the vocal multi-tracking sound a lot like something from Harry Nilsson
	
3. "Walk Right In" - The Rooftop Singers

	- Some honest-to-God acoustic guitar music for once!
	- Great folk song; very catchy
	- Breaks the mold of the doo-wop stuff
	- The accending and decending licks sound like something from a '70s prog rock band
	
4. "Hey Paula" - Paul & Paula

	- "Let's get married when we turn 18!" The Duet
	- Both singers sound good together for the most part
	
5. "Walk Like a Man" - The Four Seasons

	- Massive improvement to the previous #1's by these guys
	- The chord progression and vocals are much better
	- The "walk... walk... walk..." backing vocals are great
	
6. "Our Day Will Come" - Ruby & the Romantics

	- It's like the hybrid between Lounge and R&B
	- The xylophone is a little tacky
	
7. "He's So Fine" - The Chiffons

	- "do-lang, do-lang, do-lang" isn't too bad a backing vocal line; it's catchy!
	- Supposedly these ladies sued George Harrison for stealing this song for one of his own in 1970 (foreshadowing another #1 hit)
	
8. "I Will Follow Him" - Little Peggy March

	- I like the vocal rhythm; it reminds me of "New Killer Star" by David Bowie
	- Not half-bad vocal performace overall; but the male backing sound like a caveman singing

9. "If You Wanna Be Happy" - Jimmy Soul

	- A doo-wop song that's rhythmically driven by the vocals; I like it
	- Almost like a rap song kind of with this cadence
	- The falsetto at the end is a bit grading on the ears
	
10. "It's My Party" - Lesley Gore

	- Literally "It's my mental breakdown, and I get to choose the music!" The Song
	- Despite it being pretty standard, I like the "in-your-face" attitude the song's got
	
11. "Sukiyaki" - Kyu Sakamoto

	- First and only song sung in Japanese to reach #1
	- Despite being in a different language, I feel like this guy is being more genuine than any of the other pop songs so far
	- Honest-to-God whistling solo
	
12. "Easier Said Than Done" - The Essex

	- Well performed and the production quality is top-notch
	- Nice & upbeat
	
13. "Surf City" - Jan & Dean

	- First """"Beach Boys"""" song to reach #1
	- The "two girls for every boy" line is silly as hell
	
14. "So Much Love" - The Tymes

	- A doo-wop song with a distinct "finger-snap/wood block" rhythm
	- Not much top say; standard love song
	
15. "Fingertips Pt. 2" - Little Steve Wonder

	- Live performace from a 12-year Stevie Wonder
	- I'm absolutely amazed at how he has the whole crowd pumped up the whole time
	- It's hard to believe that he was this talented at such a young age

16. "My Boyfriend's Back" - The Angels

	- Such a silly song; "My boyfriend's gonna kick your ass!"
	- It's tongue-in-cheek though, so it's ironic enough to enjoy

17. "Blue Velvet" - Bobby Vinton

	- Probably the best Bobby Vinton song so far
	- It's just plainly better in terms of composition and performance
	- However, it's still fairly standard
	
18. "Sugar Shack" - Jimmy Glimer & The Fireballs

	- I'm pretty sure this song is poking fun of Beatniks
	- It's like a pre-cursor to "Love Shack" by the B-52s
	- Silly, but nonetheless neat early garage rock song
	
19. "Deep Purple" - Nino Tempo & April Stevens

A much better year; the variety is back, and some real bangers too! This was the last year of the "oldies" era of U.S. Pop music before The Beatles came here and changed everything, and honestly I think it was for the better. A lot of these songs from 1958-1963 really do sound the same. If you put some of these songs on a playlist and shuffled it, I couldn't tell you what artist was playing or what year it came out. However, despite all of that, It all has a naive charm, and I appreciate them all for laying the ground work for better artists to come along and build upon it all.

	- Fantastic Harmonica work on this one
	- The restrainted vocals gives the song a vunerability that most love songs lack
	
8. "Chapel of Love" - The Dixie Cups

	- Something tells me that in 1960s America, you couldn't write a love song without mentioning marriage
	- The vocals are well done overall
	- Tight Rhythm section throughout

9. "A World Without Love" - Peter & Gordon

	- The somber vocal work (and harmonized as well!) on top of the cheery instrumentation is golden songwriting
	- Amazing organ/guitar dual solo

	- Face-melting organ solo
	- The best driving Rhythm section I've heard so far
	- That ending chord played on the organ is bliss

16. "Oh, Pretty Woman" - Roy Orbison

	- Main riff on Guitar and Bass synced perfectly
	- The layed vocals of Orbison on the verses is fantastic

17. "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" - Manfred Mann

	- Biased here; remembered it from the movie Stripes
	- The call-response after the verses are well done

	- The "my baby love..." lyric is too catchy to not sing
	- A key change that doesn't seem forced but instead nature
	
19. "Leader Of The Pack" - The Shangri-Las

	- It's like the doo-wop era didn't want to die...
	- The opening line and title lyric (with motorcyle reving for good measure) are really cheesy
	- The instrumentation is really muddy
	- The little spoken-word sections stop the song dead in it's track

20. "Ringo" - Lorne Greene

	- Song about a gunslinger
	- It's like listening to a Louis L'amour audio book
	- The instrumentation is repetitive along with the "Ringooooooo" caveman backing vocal
	- Not a bad song, but feels incomplete without the rest of the audiobook(?)
	
21. "Mr. Lonely" - Bobby Vinton

	- Finally, Vinton in top form
	- Best vocal performance overall by Vinton
	- The sobbing is a little over-dramatic, but I guess it makes sense when you look at the lyrics

	- The accending pre-chorus is pretty neat
	- The backing vocals are top-notch
	
23. "I Feel Fine" - The Beatles

	- Fantastic drum and guitar work
	- That main guitar riff is way too ahead of it's time

9. "I'm Telling You Now" - Freddie & The Dreamers
	
	- The guitar intro is kinda punk (early garage rock sound?)

10. "The Game Of Love" - Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders

----
1966
----

1. "The Sound of Silence" - Simon & Garfunkel

	- Great singing from Clark overall
	- There's even a key-change halfway!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1967
----

1. "I'm a Believer" - The Monkees

	- Insanely catchy and upbeat
	- Very singable 
	- Written by Neil Diamond; of course it's great!

	- There's even an organ solo!
	
3. "Ruby Tuesday" - The Rolling Stones

	- A slow song for the Rolling Stones; much more tame compared to their other stuff
	- Kind of reminds me of "Elenor Rigby" by The Beatles; it's got similar instrumentation
	- Kind of wish it was as short as Elenor Rigby though...
	
4. "Love Is Here and Now You're Gone" - The Supremes

	- I wish I could say something good I haven't already said about The Supremes
	- As well performed and composed this song is, it really does sound the same as all of their other songs
	
5. "Penny Lane" - The Beatles

	- A nice, simple, whimsical song; fits the story being told
	- An interesting key change in the downward direction when the chorus starts up; not very common in music
	- Too fit the whimsical nature of the song is an honest-to-God trumpet solo!
	
6. "Happy Together" - The Turtles

	- The vocal cadence is too damn catchy; plus those great backing vocals
	- Love the quiet-loud dynamic between the verses and choruses; almost like a Pixies song!
	- A nice powerful ending!
	
7. "Somethin' Stupid" - Nancy Sinatra & Frank Sinatra

	- Father-Daughter love song duet; kind of got incest vibes with this one
	- Has a nice Bolero composition; very ethereal sounding
	- I real wish I could enjoy this song more, but it's too damn awkward; I can't help it
	
8. "The Happening" - The Supremes

	- The minor-key intro is quite gritty for an R&B song
	- I can't it's anything special, but this jovial song shakes up the Supremes formula a bit
	
9. "Groovin'" - The Young Rascals

	- A nice laid-back song about Groovin'. I mean it was '60s, what can you say?
	- Nice piano-chord progression and a nice subtle harmonica over the mix
	
10. "Respect" - Arthra Franklin

	- Now this is one hell of a R&B song!
	- Outstanding vocal performance from all around; the back vocals are the best I've heard so far for R&B
	- The "R-E-S-P-E-C-T" part is just great; very iconic
	
11. "Windy" - The Association

	- The bass, organ, and drums play off each other very well in; feels like one instrument
	- A lot more upbeat and happy than I expected
	- Much better than the last Association song; it's just plain better and more catchy!
	
12. "Light My Fire" - The Doors

	- That organ tone is just too good
	- The organ jam/solo in the middle with that bass line underneath it addicting to listen to
	- Jim Morrison's voice fits the song very well
	- I imagine this song was too risque for '60s America
	
13. "All You Need Is Love" - The Beatles

	- The pinnicle of love anthems; if only the world had a bit more love in it!
	- I really like the vunerable vocal performance from John Lennon; fits the theme very well
	- Despite being very somber, it can't help but cheer you up, especially with that horn section!
	
14. "Ode to Billie Joe" - Bobbie Gentry

	- A nice little, funky, folk song
	- A story about a Mississippi boy jumping of a bridge
	- I feel like this was the song that inspired the Doobie Brothers to write "Black Water"; they are very similar

15. "The Letter" - The Box Tops

	- I kind of like the raspy vocals on this one
	- It's a neat topic for a song; but that's about as much as I can about this song
	
16. "To Sir with Love" - Lulu

	- Theme for the film of the same name
	- Vocals are well-performed

17. "Incense and Peppermints" - Strawberry Alarm Clock

	- This song could not sound more psychedelic; I friggin' love it!
	- The decending chorus line is just great
	- Hell, there's even a distorted guitar solo!
	
18. "Daydream Believer" - The Monkees

	- A nice little catchy pop song
	- I like the chorus, the stacked vocals help out a lot
	
19. "Hello, Goodbye" - The Beatles

	- Even my least favorite Beatles hit is still a banger
	- The lyrics are mindlessly repetitive, but even then it's still catchy
	- The drums sound so good!
	- The stereo mix of this song is so well done; feels like it could have be laid down yesterday

----
1968
----

1. "Hello, Goodbye" - The Beatles

	- Even my least favorite Beatles hit is still a banger
	- The lyrics are mindlessly repetitive, but even then it's still catchy
	- The drums sound so good!
	- The stereo mix of this song is so well done; feels like it could have be laid down yesterday
	
2. "Judy In Disguise (With Glasses)" - John Fred and His Playboy Band

	- Amazing drum beat and bass line; very funky
	- Feels like a throwback to '50s rock in a way, I guess even back then there was a market for nostalgia
	
3. "Green Tambourine" - The Lemon Pipers

	- I guess by 1968, every rock band felt like they needed to have sitar in their songs
	- Nothing too special; probably the most middling rock song I've heard from this era so far
	
4. "Love is Blue" - Paul Mauriat

	- French pop song re-recorded as an orchestral piece
	- A nice blend of easy-listening orchestra and '60s psychedelic music
	- It's a nice song, but lacks the emotion of some of the past instrumentals to reach #1
	
5. "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" - Otis Redding

	- First posthumous #1 hit, 3 months after Redding died in a plane crash
	- Very laid-back and very introspective
	- Amazing instrumentation, so subtle and appropriate
	- Vocally impressive and catchy; hard to not sing to
	- There's even a nice little whistling solo at the end!

6. "Honey" - Bobby Goldsboro

	- Sad song mourning the loss of a wife
	- It's well-performed, but lacks the gut-punch a song like this should have
	
7. "Tighten Up Pt. 1" - Archie Bell & the Drells

	- quasi-instrumental R&B song; it's like the '60s equivalent of the Cha Cha Slide
	- First self-name drop I've heard so far
	- Amazing guitar chord progression
	- Very funky and upbeat
	- The horns come in at just the right time

8. "Mrs. Robinson" - Simon & Garfunkel

	- An excellent blend of folk and pop; perfect for the era
	- Surprisingly religious for a pop song
	- The vocals from the two are well harmonized; real powerful delivery
	- Those little guitar breaks through the song are just great
	
9. "This Guy's in Love with You" - Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass

	- A slow swingy traditional pop song
	- Great instrumentation; very whispy and ethereal
	- I really like the build-up to the powerful chorus; makes it really stand out
	- Very nice trumpet solo in the middle; subtle and appropriate
	
10. "Grazing in the Grass" - Hugh Masekela

	- A nice little jazzy insturmental
	- very upbeat and catchy; but the banging on the cowbell is a little distracting
	
11. "Hello, I Love You" - The Doors

	- The "Call Me, Maybe" of the '60s
	- That grimmy, acid distortion on the guitar is straight-up badass
	- The groove on this song is amazing
	- The build-up to the outro is also outstanding
	
12. "People Got to Be Free" - The Rascals

	- I guess The Young Rascals grew up this year, they're The Rascals now!
	- The groove of "Groovin'" from last year is back and even more upbeat this time
	- Just a great performance from everyone
	
13. "Harper Valley PTA" - Jeannie C. Riley

	- A nice, little funky pop-country song
	- Mom sticking up for her daughter against a hypocritical school PTA
	- A silly song, but probably one of the most relatable songs fron the era; this '60s counter-culture movement is turning our kids into dang hippies!
	
20. "Hey Jude" - The Beatles

	- #1 for 9 weeks, beating "Tossin' and Turnin'" for longest-running #1 up until this point, and deservingly so; this is an amazing song!
	- Probably one of the best piano ballads ever written
	- If I had to pick one song to bringing people together, this would be it
	- That outro is too damn good; I don't care if it drags the song out for another 4 minutes!
	
21. "Love Child" - Diana Ross & the Supremes

	- The Supremes attempt to blend their sound with the late '60s sound
	- The best Supremes song so far, this was what they needed to do
	- Amazing performace by Diana Ross here, and even the rest of the group does pretty good too!
	- Great chorus; very powerful

22. "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" - Marvin Gaye

	- I absolutely love that main riff; so damn gritty
	- Outstanding vocals from Gaye, so glad he's now topping the charts!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1969
----

1. "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" - Marvin Gaye

	- I absolutely love that main riff; so damn gritty
	- Outstanding vocals from Gaye, so glad he's now topping the charts!
	
2. "Crimson & Clover" - Tommy James & the Shondells

	- A laid back, psychedelic rock song that picks up the pace towards the middle
	- I really wish more songs had a guitar with a tremolo; it sounds so good!
	- There's even a tremolo effect on the vocals towards the end! Far out!
	
3. "Everyday People" - Sly & the Family Stone

	- A nice, upbeat, piano-driven R&B song
	- It feels like the kind of song for a montage in a film where the main character is driving towards some goal
	- A nice message about integration, the band of course being made up of black and white people helps the message quite well
	
4. "Dizzy" - Tommy Roe

	- Nice drum beat; very catchy and I love that snare drum!
	- Okay, now everyone wants to sound psychedelic; this is a straight-up pop song, but it sounds like they took a page out of the Doors playbook
	- I guess If I had to pick a genre that pop could borrow from, it would be psychedelic rock. It makes an okay song sound good!
	
5. "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" - The 5th Dimension

	- Two songs in one; what a deal!
	- "Aquarius" is like some kind of space-themed fever dream turned into a pop song; I'm guessing this would have been a bad trip for some
	- "Let The Sunshine" is much better and less weird, but a little too repetitive for my tastes 
	- This would probably be a fit for a film-score, but as a #1 springtime hit, it ain't it Chief.
	
6. "Get Back" - The Beatles w/ Billy Preston

	- Even when the Beatles do a straight blues song, they can't help but sound like they are revolutionizing an entire genre
	- George Harrison is such a good guitarist; those solos are too damn good for their own good
	- Let's not leave out Preston's organ solo; also iconic and well-done

7. "Love Theme from Romeo & Juilet - Henry Mancini

	- A nice little orchestral piece from the 1969 film adapatation of Shakespeare's play
	- As well done as it is, I feel like it would have been better as just a solo-piano piece
	
8. "In the Year 2525 (Exordium & Terminus)" - Zager & Evans

	- Was this the year of weird ass space-themed LSD trips?!
	- It sounds like a spaghetti-western set in space
	- It's like one big song with nothing but verses; very repetitive aside from a single key-change

9. "Honky Tonk Women" - The Rolling Stones
	
	- Amazing drum/guitar pairing; very catchy
	- This sound like the pre-cursor to "Shook Me All Night Long" by AC/DC
	- It's hard to believe this was released in 1969, it sounds like it could have come much later
	
10. "Sugar, Sugar" - The Archies

	- This is probably the single-most bubblegum poppy song I've heard; it's litterly about sugar and honey!
	- As much as I would like to dislike this song, it does it's job a little too well to hate. They had a goal, and they achieved it. Bravo.
	
11. "I Can't Get Next to You" - The Temptations

	- A very bad-ass Funk song; what else can I say?
	- This is one group where every single member was the master of their craft
	
12. "Suspicious Minds" - Elvis Presley
	
	- Elvis is back; he just can't seem to NOT be a famous rockstar
	- He did real well blending the late '60s sound with his iconic style
	- This probably his best #1 song honestly; just well-rounded and well-performed
	
13. "Wedding Bell Blues" - The 5th Dimension

	- Now that we are back on Planet Earth, the 5th Dimension are pretty good at doing Soul
	- It's good, but I can't say it stands out from the other groups we've heard so far
	
14. "Come Together/Something" - The Beatles

	- Another two'fer! the first two tracks off of Abbey Road
	- If you haven't listened to Abbey Road front-to-back yet, you're doing yourself a diservice
	- I still have my Abbey Road poster I got at my 5th grade Scholastic Book Fair hanging up on my wall
	- "Come Together" is the epitome of badassery and "Something" is probably one of the most graceful and vunerable love songs I've ever heard
	
15. "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" - Steam
	
	- What's that I hear? A double-kick pedal? I did'nt know Steam was a death metal band!
	- To be honest, it's something I'd only want to hear at a sporting event or a nightclub
	
16. "Leaving on a Jet Plane" - Peter, Paul and Mary

	- A neat little soft rock/folk song written by John Denver
	- Very pleasant to listen to; easy on the ears
	- Amazing performance
	
17. "Someday We'll Be Together" - Diana Ross & The Supremes

	- "It's the last week of the '60s, let's try and squeeze in another Supremes #1 hit!" is what America said
	- A much more restrained performance from the group; I think it suits them well

17. "In the Year 2525 (Exordium & Terminus)" - Zager & Evans

Another year of "hit or miss"; it was either a legendary song or a complete dud. Either way that's gonna wrap up the '60s decade. We went from dawdling dop-wops to LSD-induced space-westerns in a span of a decade; let's see how the '70s fare!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1970
----

1. "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" - B. J. Thomas

	- A nice swingy pop song; it surprisingly personifies a light rainy day very well
	- A nice trumpet is sprinkled throughout the song
	- I kinda like how the song picks up pace during the outro
	
2. "I Want You Back" - The Jackson 5

	- The first #1 for Michael Jackson at age 11
	- I really like the up and down nature of the bass line, really funky!
	- That chorus is just great, especially with those backing vocals
	
3. "Venus" - Shocking Blue

	- Extremely catchy psychedelic folk song
	- The chorus is just fantastic... "She's got it! Ooh baby she's got it!"
	- I like that little guitar solo after the first verse
	- That reverbed vocal line in the middle is also great
	
4. "Thank You (Falenttinme Be Mice Elf Agin)/Everybody Is a Star" - Sly & The Family Stone

	- Did the band have a stroke when naming this song?
	- Our first pop-n-slap bassline; we are now getting into some funky territory now
	- It's surprisingly simple with very little instrumentation; very effective with very little
	- Another great chorus this year! "Thank you... for lettin' me... be myself!"
	- "Everybody Is a Star" is a nice, relaxed, relief from the overload of funk from "Thank You". Sometimes you just gotta take a break!
	
5. "Bridge Over Troubled Water" - Simon & Garfunkel

	- A piano ballad sung by Art Garfunkel about being there for a friend
	- Extremely emotional and very sincere
	- When Paul Simon comes in on the third verse, it sends this song into the stratosphere
	- The build-up to that cannon shot on the final chorus line is absolutely legendary
	
6. "Let It Be" - The Beatles

	- Wow, another legendary piano ballad!
	- A great message; a song to de-escalate just about any situation
	
7. "ABC" - Jackson 5

	- It's like an even more upbeat and catchy version of the last Jackson 5 song
	- The song's lyrics are kind of silly, but considering it's being sung by an 11-year Michael Jackson it makes sense

8. "American Woman/No Sugar Tonight" - The Guess Who

	- I have a sneaking suspicion that the "American Woman" in this song is a metaphor for America itself...
	- That tremolo guitar riff with that fuzzy guitar lead is far out maaaaan!
	- There's also a pretty solid groove with the rhythm section on this one
	- Funny enough, I actually like the B-Side "No Sugar Tonight" better; kind of wish it was the A-side instead

9. "Everything Is Beautiful" - Ray Stevens

	- A World Peace anthem; just buy everyone a Coke, and everything will be alright, right?
	- As jovial as the song is, I can't imagine it actually brought people together that much
	- Can't say I like the double key change towards the end
	
10. "The Long And Winding Road/For You Blue" - The Beatles

	- The Beatles final #1 hit, a month after they broke up
	- They had 20 #1 hits; my God...
	- A very emotional, orchestral song
	- This really does feel like a nice send off for the Beatles, it's almost like the song is them riding off into the sunset
	- The B-side "For You Blue" is nice little blues song sung by George Harrison; a welcome addition

11. "The Love You Save" - The Jackson 5

	- Can't say I like this one that much, I feel like they were pushing Michael really hard on this one and it shows
	- The Instrumation keeps this song from being bad; can't go wrong with a solid funk foundation
	
12. "Mama Told Me (Not To Come) - Three Dog Night

	- "Don't go to parties if they are doing copious amounts of drugs and alcohol" The Song
	- That main organ riff under the whole song is just great
	- A great chorus with great instrumentation

13. "(They Long to Be) Close to You" - The Carpenters

	- A nice little soft-rock love song
	- Karen Carpenter's vocals are pretty good; a shame how she died
	
14. "Make It with You" - Bread

	- A very underrated soft rock band; I always thought they should have be bigger then they were
	- Whenever people ask me what kind of music I like, I tell them "I listen to everything from Bread to Cannibal Corpse."
	- Very tight playing and stupidly-well composed, especially with that string section
	
15. "War" - Edwin Starr

	- Probably the single-most recognizable anti-war song... and very deserving. This is a damn jam!
	- One of the most contagiously catchy songs every written; too good!
	
16. "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" - Diana Ross

	- Ross was always meant to break away from The Supremes; she was always better solo... at least I think so.
	- Despite the dawdling talking sections, the instrumentation and chorus is just outstanding
	
17. "Cracklin' Rosie" - Neil Diamond
	
	- Now Neil Diamond is in the spotlight instead of some other band playing his songs!
	- The "play it now! play it now! play it now my baby!" break after each chorus is THE right way to stop a song

18. "I'll Be There" - The Jackson 5

	- A slow love song from the Jacksons
	- I really like the harpsichord underneath the song
	- Despite not being their wheelhouse, I actually think this is better than their upbeat songs
	
19. "I Think I Love You" - The Partridge Family

	- "Hey everybody! Check it out! It's the White Jackson 5!"
	- As obvious that this is a product to be sold, I can't say the music is bad; it's well done
	- The sort of gypsy/bohemian style of the song is quite nice; feels like a song you'd hear in a stageplay
	
20. "The Tears of a Clown" - Smokey Robinson & The Miricles

	- It's like a fusion of a renaissance fair and an episode of Soul Train
	- Smokey's falsetto is very good, but the overbearing tambourine masks it too much
	
21. "My Sweet Lord/Isn't It a Pity" - George Harrison

	- It barely took a few months before one of The Beatles scored a #1 hit after their breakup
	- A very religious song that like SUPER inclusive, as the lyrics mention a plethora of deities
	- Those slide guitar solos are addicting to listen to
	- The backing vocals are really what make this song great... "Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"
	- The B-side "Isn't It a Pity", as good as the lyrics are, kind of drags on for 7 minutes; it can be shorter for sure

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Bridge Over Troubled Water" - Simon & Garfunkel
2. "Make It with You" - Bread
3. "Let It Be" - The Beatles
4. "War" - Edwin Starr

18. "The Tears of a Clown" - Smokey Robinson & The Miricles
19. "ABC" - Jackson 5
20. "The Love You Save" - The Jackson 5
21. "Everything Is Beautiful" - Ray Stevens

Another great year! Although there are some duds, the greatness of whats good makes up for that. I can only hope the '70s can keep this pace.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1971
----

1. "My Sweet Lord/Isn't It a Pity" - George Harrison

	- It barely took a few months before one of The Beatles scored a #1 hit after their breakup
	- A very religious song that like SUPER inclusive, as the lyrics mention a plethora of deities
	- Those slide guitar solos are addicting to listen to
	- The backing vocals are really what make this song great... "Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"
	- The B-side "Isn't It a Pity", as good as the lyrics are, kind of drags on for 7 minutes; it can be shorter for sure
	
2. "Knock Three Times" - Tony Orlando & Dawn

	- The premise of this song is just weird; it's like they are P-O-Ws and have to communicate this way so the prison guards won't know they are trying to hook up
	- I mean, he can just knock on her door and just talk to her...
	- Silly song, but not a bad song
	
3. "One Bad Apple" - The Osmonds

	- Forget what I said about The Partridge Family; THIS is the white Jackson 5. The resemblance is uncanny
	- One Apple DOES spoil the whole bunch. What drugs were they on?
	- Scratch that, maybe they weren't on ENOUGH drugs.
	
4. "Me and Bobby McGee" - Janis Joplin

	- Another posthumous #1 song; several months after Joplin's death
	- Song written by Kris Kristofferson; about the relationship of two homeless drifters
	- This song is just great; good story-telling, good vocals, good instrumentation
	- It's tragic we lost such a unique voice in music

5. "Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)" - The Temptations

	- A very relaxing song to listen to; personifies daydreaming too well
	- Those vocals are just too good
	- On top of that, the string section does a very good job of serving the song

6. "Joy to the World" - Three Dog Night

	- Accomplishes what "Everything Is Beautiful" couldn't.
	- Turns out making an upbeat and catchy song brings people together better then any World Peace anthem could
	- Song is kinda of silly, but I think that's what they were going for

7. "Brown Sugar" - The Rolling Stones

	- A nice blue rock song; almost like a throwback to the Rock N' Roll days
	- Let's take a moment to recognize Keith Richard on guitar; he can write a damn good riff!
	- There's even a sax solo! I feel like it's been a while since I've heard one of those
	
8. "Want Ads" - Honey Cone

	- A love song about looking through the classifieds to find a man
	- You know, like in a newspaper?
	- Anybody my age or younger remember those?
	- A decent funk song; catchy and upbeat
	
9. "It's Too Late/I Feel the Earth Move" - Carole King

	- A soft rock song that manages to be really funky
	- A really good chorus; very catchy
	- I love the guitar/tenor-sax/organ jam in the middle; so good!
	- Damn, I really love this B-Side "I Feel the Earth Move". I'm impressed how well King blends soft rock with funk!

10. "Indian Reservation (The Lamnent of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)" - Paul Revere & The Raiders

	- A bluey rock song about The Cherokee Nation
	- The early '70s saw a large civil rights movement focused on justice for Native Americans
	- A lot better than the previous Native-American themed songs we've heard. Like, WAAAAY better
	- Is this Jethro Tull? It sounds like Jethro Tull... and that's a good thing!
	
11. "You've Got A Friend" - James Taylor

	- Acoustic soft rock song about friendship
	- Those arpeggiated chords are fantastic; I wish this song was easier to play on guitar. It's hard as nails!
	- That bridge section is one of the best I've ever heard; the perfect chords!
	
12. "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" - Bee Gees

	- First Bee Gees #1 hit; before they went disco
	- A slow swingy breakup song
	- It's an okay song, not too bad
	
13. "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey" - Paul & Linda McCartney

	- Not a double single, just one song with two halves
	- The first half is so hard to describe. It's like a pop-song while at the same time being completely genreless
	- The second half feels like something off of Magical Mystery Tour; it's like some kind of art rock experiment
	- Changes gears all over the place, you could skip around this song and each section would sound like it's own song
	- I like it but maybe Paul is getting a little too carried away here
	
14. "Go Away Little Girl" - Donny Osmond

	- Oh boy, it's a cover of one the previous #1 hit songs, and I didn't like that one to much
	- Okay, now it's even weirder now that a little kid is singing it
	- I will say it's better than the original; but not by much
	
15. "Maggie May/Reason to Believe" - Rod Stewart

	- Classic folk rock song
	- Any song with a well-played 12-string guitar will always be good in my book
	- I love the simple clean guitar solo after the second verse; serves the song well
	- The mandolin that comes in towards the end is great; really finalizes the song
	- The B-side "Reason to Believe" is okay, the organ is a little too overbearing
	
16. "Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves" - Cher

	- Minor-key folk song, haven't seen one of these in a while
	- For such a simple folk song, there's soooo many instruments playing at once
	- It's a good song, just kind of wish it was a little simpler 
	
17. "Theme from Shaft" - Isaac Hayes

	- Theme from the classic blaxploitation film
	- Talk about a funk overload! so many wah pedals and horn sections!
	- I couldn't think of a better song for a film like Shaft; too good!
	
18. "Family Affair" - Sly & The Family Stone

	- "Let's follow up one funk overload with another!" said America in 1971
	- This one's more of a spoken word song; with the lyrics being said over a funk groove
	- It's a good song, but I like their previous songs better
	
19. "Brand New Key" - Melanie

	- A very cheery folk song
	- This chick rollerskates everwhere doesn't she?
	- The vocals on this one are insane; it sounds like she's going to burst into tears any second

Not all that great of a year, honestly. Some good stuff here and there, but this felt like a really tacky year.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1972
----

1. "Brand New Key" - Melanie

	- A very cheery folk song
	- This chick rollerskates everwhere doesn't she?
	- The vocals on this one are insane; it sounds like she's going to burst into tears any second
	
2. "American Pie" - Don McLean

	- Amazing folk song about "The Day The Music Died" February 3, 1959. Quite a tragic day for Rock N' Roll
	- Each verse is like a vignette loaded with metaphors. It's a little artsy, but really does a good job of capturing the feeling people had on that day
	- Probably the single most singable chorus ever written
	- A pop song is usually 3 minutes or so long, but this manages to break that trend at over 8 and a half minutes long. Impressive!

3. "Let's Stay Together" - Al Green

	- This is an amazing song; the performance is so restrained which really makes it feel more like Green is talking directly to you
	- The galloping beat behind the song is just great; it somehow gels well with the vocal performance
	- Of course you can't have an outstanding soul song without horns!
	
4. "Without You" - Harry Nilsson

	- That one song everybody think Mariah Carey did originally. Funny enough, this is also a cover
	- Probably my favorite songwriter of all time; it's a shame he never got the level of stardom as some of his contemporaries
	- An amazing performace from Nilsson here, but it's far from his best work. I'd recommend checking out his other songs
	
5. "Heart of Gold" - Neil Young

	- A folk rock classic; so gritty and heavy sounding. Neil Young is probably the main inspiration for a lot of the rock and metal we'd hear years later
	- Great harmonica work on this one; the icing on the cake!
	- The mixing on this song makes it sound like it was done yesterday. It's so good!
	
6. "A Horse with No Name" - America

	- America were really great songwriters, but I can't help but laugh that their most lyrically incoherent song was their most popular
	- Either than that, this is an amazing song. That open tuning on the 12-string guitar, those vocal harmonies, that light reverb over the whole song; just amazing
	
7. "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" - Roberta Flack

	- A slow jazz song dtiven by the vocals
	- The soft acoustic guitar play well off the vocals
	- Very well done, at no point does it go overboard, it's simple yet powerful
	
8. "Oh Girl" - The Chi-Lites

	- Very reminiscent of the R&B from the '50s but still distinctly '70s sounding
	- Another well done song; everything sounds good together
	- I do think the melodica sounds a little tacky, at least from the this era
	
10. "I'll Take You There" - The Staple Singers

	- A nice little laid-back funk song
	- The guitar/harmonica solo is great
	- The heavy-breathing vocals are little distracting; it's not like she's trying to be sexy, it's more like she's out of breathing

11. "The Candy Man" - Sammy Davis Jr.

	- It took quite a while for this Rat-Pack singer to get a #1 hit
	- This was written for Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory... it's about the candy man
	- Kind of a silly little song, but it fits the score for the film well enough
	
12. "Song Sung Blue" - Neil Diamond

	- A nice, very swingy song
	- The organ and horn sections are very well done
	- A good song, but it kind of drags on a bit
	
13. "Lean on Me" - Bill Withers

	- Song about being there for a friend
	- Those iconic piano chords; too good!
	- Very singable
	- Simple, yet effective
	
14. "Alone Again (Naturally) - Gilbert O'Sullivan

	- I think this is the first #1 from an Irish artist (an ACTUAL Irish person from Ireland)
	- It's a nice little song about loneliness; nice piano chords
	- I really like that classical guitar solo in the middle
	- It's a good song, but there's nothing too special about it

15. "Brandy (You're a Find Girl) - Looking Glasses

	- I like the "do do do do do" backing vocals, but the main vocals sound weird
	- It's an okay song, kind of wish there was more to it
	
16. "Black And White" - Three Dog Night

	- A song about the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision
	- Honestly, this song is really lame. For a political song, it really lacks that "get up and fight!" energy; it's almost like a lullaby

17. "Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me" - Mac Davis

	- Easy-listening song with a bit of a country vibe to it
	- I would say it sounds generic, but supposedly Davis' record told him to write a song with a "hook" so he made this. It's almost like a parody of a pop song in a way!
	- Can't rank to high though, it still is just a middle-of-the-road song
	
18. "Ben" - Michael Jackson

	- First #1 from Michael Jackson as a solo artist
	- Made for the film of the same name; it's about a boy who befriends a rat named Ben
	- It's an okay song, funny enough it's Jackson's performance that makes it better. Otherwise it'd be pretty generic I think

19. "My Ding-a-Ling" - Chuck Berry

	- A live performance of a song about... a set of silver bells on a string
	- WTF America? This is what you were listening to 1972?
	- I guess it's a silly enough song, but I just can't get over how this was the most popular song at one point. This is the kind of thing you put at the end of an album as a bonus track
	- I think the one redeeming factor is just how much fun Chuck Berry is having with the audience here

20. "I Can See Clearly Now" - Johnny Nash

	- Not to be confused with Johnny Cash
	- A nice little happy song; I love the chorus
	- Hell, there's even a honest-to-God accordion in this song, and it sounds good!
	- Also an amazing Bridge section; outstanding vocal harmonies!
	
21. "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" - The Tempatations
	
	- Amazing intro; That scratchy wah-pedal guitar, that bassline, that string section... so damn funky!
	- Great vocal performace from everyone
	- Those little reverberated trumpet solos after the choruses are great

22. "I Am a Woman" - Helen Reddy

	- Folky feminist anthem
	- very upbeat and catchy
	- It's a good song, but it's a little too on the nose but I imagine
	
23. "Me and Mrs. Jones" - Billy Paula

	- A nice little soul song about an affair
	- Very dreamy and ethreal sounding
	- Great vocal performance; especially when the band stops to let Paula sing

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Heart of Gold" - Neil Young
2. "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" - The Tempatations
3. "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" - Roberta Flack
4. "Me and Mrs. Jones" - Billy Paula
5. "A Horse with No Name" - America
6. "Lean on Me" - Bill Withers

12. "Oh Girl" - The Chi-Lites
13. "Song Sung Blue" - Neil Diamond
14. "Ben" - Michael Jackson
15. "The Candy Man" - Sammy Davis Jr.
16. "Brandy (You're a Find Girl) - Looking Glasses
17. "I'll Take You There" - The Staple Singers
18. "Brand New Key" - Melanie
19. "Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me" - Mac Davis
20. "My Ding-a-Ling" - Chuck Berry
21. "Black And White" - Three Dog Night

This was probably the most "meh" year so far. Even the really good stuff was just okay compared to the previous year's good stuff. However, it wasn't a bad year, I would mind hearing most of these again.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1973
----

1. "You're So Vain" - Carly Simon

	- An insanely shreddy bass intro for some reason
	- I like how the verses are in a minor key but the choruses are in a major key
	- It may seem a little out of place, but I like the dissonant guitar solo in the middle
	- I thought I heard Mick Jagger doing backing vocals, so I looked it up. Turns out he did but was uncredited!

2. "Superstition" - Stevie Wonder

	- This is when Stevie Wonder went on his "perfect run" of singles and albums. I look forward to this!
	- It cannot be understated how damn funky that electric organ is... just... wow.
	- Of course there's a perfect horn section!
	
3. "Crocodile Rock" - Elton John

	- Probably the most popular music artist of the '70s
	- A song reminiscing of the '50s Rock N' Roll era
	- Very catchy, although a little silly, especially the "la la la laaaaa!" section

4. "Killing Me Softly with His Song" - Roberta Flack

	- I'm gonna say something controversial... I really don't like this song O_O
	- It's just way too mopey and tacky for me
	- Either than that, the instrumentation is pretty good
	
5. "Love Train" - The O'Jays

	- World Peace song
	- Soul Train summed up in one song... honestly that's all I can think about when I head this
	- It's a good song, but nothing too special; overplayed on the radio
	
6. "The Night the Lights When Out in Georgia" - Vicki Lawrence

	- Song about the execution of an innocent man caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
	- Surprise! It was the NARRATOR who was the culprit! whoooooaaaaa!
	- Honestly, the story isn't all that gripping compared to the other folky storytelly songs we've heard so far
	- Also kinda boring too, not all that exciting to listen to
	
7. "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree" - Dawn feat. Tony Orlando

	- A happy, cheery song about a prison convict getting out hoping his girlfriend still loves him
	- Not just one yellow ribbon, but a HUNDRED! WHAT A HAPPY ENDING!
	- It's a nice little song, but nothing too special
	
8. "You Are the Sunshine of My Life" - Stevie Wonder
	
	- Probably one of the most relaxing songs ever, at least in the first half
	- It's almost like a prog rock song with how many instruments and key changes it has; it's like the band "Yes" wrote it!
	
9. "Frankenstein" - The Edgar Winter Group

	- Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Instrumental
	- Holy shit, I can't believe this was a #1 hit. It's like America decided "we love heavy metal now all of a sudden!"
	- That main guitar riff stacked with that bassline is soooo friggin' heavy!
	- Also, let's appreciated the insane talent of every member; it's like everyone is a virtuoso playing at the top of their craft
	- Insane drum solo and keyboard solo!
	- AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	
10. "My Love" - Paul McCartney & Wings

	- Looks like Paul finally got a new band to play with him
	- This is just flat out boring; it kind of just drags on for 4 minutes
	
11. "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth) - George Harrison

	- Wow, two different Beatles got a #1 hit next to each other
	- George really was the better Beatle after they broke up and it shows here
	- I really like the slide guitar-solo in the middle; very distinctly George sounding
	- I like it, but I can't say it's something too special
	
12. "Will It Go Round in Circles" - Billy Preston

	- You know, Preston is considered one of many contendants for the "5th Beatle" so I guess you could say we had 3 former-Beatle #1 hits in a row this year!
	- A pretty good and upbeat funk song, but it's nothing too special; good piano work though

13. "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown" - Jim Croce

	- A boogy-woogy song about a mean hustler from southside Chicago who gets his ass kicked in a barfight
	- Way too catchy and singable
	- Jim Croce was a talent who was taken from this world way too soon
	
14. "The Morning After" - Maureen McGovern

	- Song written for the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure; kinda of a weird flex but okay
	- I guess it's okay; it's overly melodramatic for such a simple song
	
15. "Touch Me In The Morning" - Diana Ross

	- Painfully mediocre; it's performed well enough, but it's just... bleh.
	- Really, that's it.
	
16. "Brother Louie" - Stories

	- Song about an interracial couple; I imagine people back in 1973 were still not okay with that, so a song like this was warrented
	- Really good guitar and string solos throughout
	- Either than that, it's a good song, but nothing else worth mentioning
	
17. "Let's Get It On" - Marvin Gaye

	- This is probably the single most sex-postive song ever written, and it was written in 1973! You'd think this was too risque for the day, but the quality of the song was just too good to not be a #1 hit
	- That accending chord progression is something just great; hardly any songs use it
	- It's a damn shame that this song has been used in so many corny comedies during "sexy" scenes. Kinda ruins the legacy of the song
	
18. "Delta Dawn" - Helen Reddy
	
	- A country song about... I don't know. I think it's about a middle-aged women who is single and delusional about a suitor she met many years ago who told her she would marry her, but she still thinks he's interested? I have no clue
	- I really like the chorus; it's got a very stong gospel feel to it, especially with those backing vocals

19. "We're an American Band" - Grand Funk

	- A song with a nice fusion of funk and hard rock
	- Real good riff during the verses
	- Also great guitar solo too!
	
20. "Half-Breed" - Cher

	- Song about a "half-breed" women who's father was white and mother was Native American
	- Man, America must have been going through some tough times regarding interracial relations this year
	- It's an okay song; nothing too exciting

21. "Angie" - The Rolling Stones

	- Acoustic ballad written by Keith Richards
	- It's an okay song by Rolling Stones standards which means is pretty good, but I wish it was better

22. "Midnight Train to Georgia" - Gladys Knight & The Pips

	- A nice little soul/funk song
	- It's a good song, not much else to say; very nice to listen to
	
23. "Keep on Truckin'" - Eddie Kendricks

	- A very upbeat funk song
	- Those speedy organ chords are top-notch!
	- For the first time, a #1 Hit song actually manages to make a xylophone sound badass!

24. "Photograph" - Ringo Starr

	- Finally, Ringo gets a #1 hit!
	- We even got George Harrison on the 12-string acoustic!
	- Honestly, is just an "okay" song; there's some good instrumentation here and there, but it's just kind of drags on
	
25. "Top Of The World" - The Carpenters

	- A sort of country-pop song; it's got a steel-guitar and eletric piano
	- It's so cheery, you'd think you were in a land of cotton candy and rainbows
	- It's a good song, maybe just a little too cheery. This is like what you'd play in a horror film to put the viewer on edge
	
26. "The Most Beautiful Girl" - Charlie Rich

	- Another country song with a steel-guitar! we got a two-fer this month!
	- Rich's has got a pretty good voice
	- Another "okay" song; but it's well-performed
	
27. "Time In A Bottle" - Jim Croce
	
	- Another posthumous hit, a few months after Croce died in a plane crash
	- It's got a nice bohemian/gypsy feel to it, I like it
	- Neat lyrics, but far from his best work I think

OVERALL RANKING	
	
1. "Let's Get It On" - Marvin Gaye
2. "Frankenstein" - The Edgar Winter Group
3. "Superstition" - Stevie Wonder
4. "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown" - Jim Croce

26. "Touch Me In The Morning" - Diana Ross
27. "The Night the Lights When Out in Georgia" - Vicki Lawrence

Wow, America really couldn't make up their mind this year on what they liked. There were 27 #1 hit songs this year! What can I say? Well what I can say is that it was another "meh" year. I like how rock and folk are starting to evolve into something new, but I can feel "disco" quickly approaching. Let's just hope that whatever disco hits become #1 are actually pretty good.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1974
----

1. "Time In A Bottle" - Jim Croce
	
	- Another posthumous hit, a few months after Croce died in a plane crash
	- It's got a nice bohemian/gypsy feel to it, I like it
	- Neat lyrics, but far from his best work I think
	
2. "The Joker" - Steve Miller Band

	- Nice laid back, acoustic jam
	- The cat-calling wah slide-guitar is so silly
	- I mean the wah slide-guitar is great everywhere else
	- Great chorus; I imagine every campfire hippie guitarist was playing this
	
3. "Show and Tell" - Al Wilson

	- Nice piano chords and string section
	- I really like the chorus; fits the song very well
	- Overall, a well done song
	
4. "You're Sixteen (You're Beautiful And You're Mine) - Ringo Starr

	- Cover of an old boogy-woogy Rock N' Roll song
	- THIS was what inspired The Beatles, just so you know
	- WTF is that a kazoo solo?
	- I guess it's okay; not terrible
	
5. "The Way We Were" - Barbra Streisand

	- Slow piano ballad made for the film of the same name
	- Another slow love song made for a romantic drama; this is one hell of a specific genre
	- It's okay; nothing too special
	
6. "Love's Theme" - Love Unlimited Orchestra

	- First Barry White #1; instrumental
	- Lives up to it's name pretty good; sounds like what a love theme would be
	- Great work all around; great string section, great rhythm section, and a nice funky guitar to top it off
	
7. "Seasons in the Sun" - Terry Jacks

	- It's actually not a anti-Vietnam war song, just a song mourning the loss of a close friend; written in 1961 by a Belgian songwriter
	- I can't say I like the key changes on this one; a little too jarring
	- It's an okay song; a little too melodramatic for me
	
8. "Dark Lady" - Cher

	- Song about a gypsy fortune-teller in New Orleans
	- The sound fits the gypsy theme; but even then it's a pretty boring song
	
9. "Sunshine on My Shoulders" - John Denver

	- A nice little, happy acoustic folk song
	- That chord progression is so good; and the little alterations throughout are just great
	- Denver's voice is really good and works well with the arpeggiated guitar chords

10. "Hooked on a Feeling" - Blue Swede

	- Oh god, it's the "OOGA-CHAKA-OOGA-OOGA" song
	- Like I have no clue who thought that was a good idea, it like DOES NOT fit the song AT ALL
	- Either than that, the sections without the singing tiki-torch totems are pretty decent
	
11. "Bennie and the Jets" - Elton John

	- Contrary to what it sounds like, it's not a live performance. It was added afterwards to make it sound that was
	- I really like that staggard rhythm; it works well with those outstanding piano chords
	- Amazing vocal performace by Elton John; kind of goofy, but well done
	- Those little electric organ bits at the end is just the icing on the cake
	
12. "TSOP (The Sound of Philidelphia) - MFSB & The Three Degrees

	- An instrumental song written to be the ambassador of Philidelphia Soul; a sub-genre of soul to come from... well, from Philly.
	- What can I say? It's an amazing song. Top notch performaces from all of the musicians involved and well crafted
	- Well, there are some backing vocals near the end, which are just great!

13. "The Loco-Motion" - Grand Funk

	- Cover of the Little Eva song that was a #1 back in 1962
	- Honestly, I like the originally better; this is just a straight cover of the song with worse mixing
	- The distorted guitar solo is really out of place here, and it's not all that great either

14. "The Streak" - Ray Stevens

	- A silly novelty country song about a streaker
	- It sounds like a skit off of Yee-Haw made into a record
	- That friggin slide whistle is just too damn silly
	- I can't hate this song; it's literally made to sound as silly as possible. Sometimes America can be weird and make some songs get to #1
	
15. "Band On The Run" - Paul McCartney & Wings

	- I really like the nice and calm intro before going into the funky minor-key change
	- Is this song prog enough? another key-change by a whole ass brass section into the main progression
	- The main progression is just great; something that sounds like it could have been a Beatles song
	- Those little guitar bits during the chorus are just great; very catchy!

16. "Billy, Don't Be a Hero" - Bo Donaldson & The Heywoods

	- Silly novelty-pop song about a Civil War Union soldier getting killed in action
	- It's just so damn tacky; it could have been a song tackling the tragedy of death in war, but it sounds like a teenager crush song done by the Jackson 5
	- If there is any redeeming factor of this song, it's that the drummer is friggin killing it on the set

17. "Sundown" - Gordon Lightfoot

	- A funky little country song
	- I like the stacked vocals on the chorus; sounds good
	- It's a good song, although it's nothing too special
	- Not so much of a fun fact; the woman this song is about is the same woman who would later inject the 11 consectutive speedballs that killed John Belushi. "Oops! I just accidentally killed him! Silly me!"

18. "Rock the Boat" - The Hues Corporation

	- A nice, little, disco song
	- The chorus is kind of catchy
	- Besides that, it's an okay song; I like the insturmentation at the end with the brass section and guitar
	
19. "Rock Your Baby" - George McCrae

	- Disco song
	- What's that? Is that a Roland Drum Machine I hear?
	- It's even a clave rhythm! Nice!
	- Besides that, it's an okay song; nothing too special. Kind of drags on
	
20. "Annie's Song" - John Denver
	
	- A nice little folk love song
	- I really like the guitar on this one; sounds real nice
	- I can't say I like the build up to the strings and other instruments; kind of overkill
	- The vocals are also a little to forced I think; wish they were more restrained instead
	
21. "Feel Like Makin' Love" - Roberta Flack

	- Man, the Grammys REALLY loved Roberta Flack. She won Song Of The Year 2 years in a row with "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and "Killing Me Softly with His Song" and almost 3 years with this one!
	- I like this one, it's real calm and laid back. Either than that, it's nothing too special

22. "The Night Chicago Died" - Paper Lace

	- Song about a fictional shootout between Al Capone's gang and the police
	- I don't know, this one's just the most plain boring rock song ever
	
23. "(You're) Having My Baby" - Paul Anka & Odia Coates

	- I'm sorry, this song just comes off real creepy. I mean it's sincere enough, but the lyrics (and performace) are like an alien wrote them. Especially the "she didn't get the abortion" part
	- Well, I guess someone had to write a love song about pregnancy; kind of wish it wasn't this awkward though

24. "I Shot The Sheriff" - Eric Clapton

	- Cover of the Bob Marley classic
	- It's pretty good; surprised this was a #1 hit considering the types of music people were listening to at this time
	- Clapton is such a great guitarist; even when his guitar is hidden in the back of the mix, it's distict enough to stand out

25. "Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe" - Barry White

	- I think Barry White is the only one who can get away with talky parts in songs
	- One of the most distinct Bass-Baratone voices ever
	- That vocal line during the chorus with those drums is just to groovy
	
26. "Rock Me Gently" - Andy Kim

	- Kim doing his best Neil Diamond impression
	- It sounds okay; but I can't help but think this is a dollar-store Neil Diamond song
	- I will say, that is a tasty electric solo in the middle
	
27. "I Honestly Love You" - Olivia Newton-John

	- Slow piano ballad
	- If there ever was a contendant for "most generic love song" I think this would be one
	- Maybe I should be too mean; it is well performed and it's not over-bearing or anything like that

28. "Nothing From Nothing" - Billy Preston
	
	- Preston showing once again that he is king of piano funk
	- Very upbeat and catchy; I like it
	
29. "Then Came You" - Dionne Warwick & The Spinners

	- It's an okay soul song; there really isn't anything about this song that stands out
	
30. "You Haven't Done Nothin'" - Stevie Wonder

	- Song about Richard Nixon. Ooh, spicy!
	- Nice double-negative there, Stevie.
	- Sorry, enough ribbing... this song is absolutely amazing!
	- That "Doo Da Wop!" line is just too damn good
	- Everything about this song is just perfect; the vocals, the electric organ, the percussion, the brass section. It's just too good!

31. "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" - Bachman-Turner Overdrive

	- Hard rock song
	- Great chord progression leading up to that chorus
	- Great chorus! those distorted guitar chords are awesome!
	- I really like those reverberated almost back-masked sounding guitar leads throughout the song; gives is a fuller sound

32. "Whatever Gets You Thru the Night" - John Lennon

	- Wow, it really took this long for John to get his first #1 hit song
	- Okay, there is way too much going on here. It's such a cacophony of sound
	- This sounds NOTHING like something that John would do; I feel like there might be a ghostwriter involved here XD

33. "I Can Help" - Billy Swan

	- A nice little rockabilly song
	- Very cheery and nice to listen to
	- I really like that guitar bit after the bridge and during the outro
	- I like the silly double false ending!
	
34. "Kung Fu Fighting" - Carl Douglas

	- Novelty song capitalizing on the Kung-Fu craze of the early '70s
	- By the way, the "Oriental Riff" we usually associate with Far East, is actually originally from a Turkish stageplay of Aladdin
	- Even though it's probably a bit dated by today's standards, I still think this is a good novelty song; it's just well-done
	
35. "Cat's in the Cradle" - Harry Chapin

	- Song about a rocky Son-Father relationship
	- Wow, a sitar! it's been a while since we heard one of those!
	- Each verse is a nice little slice of the boy's upbringing; good storytelling
	- The chorus lyrics make no sense to me, I guess I'm too young to get the metaphors
	
36. "Angie Baby" - Helen Reddy

	- Song about "Rock N' Roll can make your daughter hallucinate!" or something like that I duuno
	- It's okay I guess; kinda tacky

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1975
----

1. "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" - Elton John

	- Cover of the Beatles song
	- A faithful enough cover; if anything, it's less "out there" and more palatable to a general audience
	
2. "Mandy" - Barry Manilow

	- Slow piano ballad
	- Has a nice chorus; can't say much else, pretty standard affair
	
3. "Please Mr. Postman" - The Carpenters

	- Cover of The Marvelettes #1 hit song from 1961
	- Pretty standard cover, it sounds almost exactly the same besides the fact that the mixing is better and it's got Karen Carpenter singing it
	- Has a nice sax and guitar solo in it
	
4. "Laughter in the Rain" - Neil Sadaka

	- Oh god, the "shooby-dooby-doo-wop" Sedaka is back
	- Actually, I'm impressed. Instead of being unbearably doo-woppy, he's taken well to the '70s sound
	- Good chorus; I like the stacked vocals
	- There's even a nice pleasant sax solo in it!
	
5. "Fire" - Ohio Players

	- Insanely funky song
	- Badass guitar solo in the middle
	- Kind of one-note overall; it would sound good in a disco/club, but that's about it
	
6. "You're No Good" - Linda Ronstadt

	- Catchy chorus; blends rock with funk well enough
	- That little disonant guitar break in the middle is great; rarely seen in a pop song
	- I even like the guitar solo as well
	
7. "Pick Up the Pieces" - Average White Band

	- Funk instrumental
	- Hot damn, there's nothing AVERAGE about this band. They're friggin MASTERS of funk!
	- Everything about this piece is just great; the horns, the guitar, the drum groove, the hype-man vocals in the back, it's just great!
	- Now THAT'S one hell of a sax solo!
	
8. "Best of My Love" - The Eagles

	- Real nice strummed 12-string acoustic guitar chords; very pleasant
	- Besides that, it's nothing too special; it' just kind of drags out for 3 and a half minutes
	
9. "Have You Never Been Mellow" - Olivia Newton-John

	- Is that a threat, Olivia?
	- The chorus is kind of good; everything else is just boring
	- I really don't think Newton-John's voice is that great. I mean, it's on point but it's so airy and plain that's it's putting me to sleep
	
10. "Black Water" - The Doobie Brothers

	- Delta bluesy/bluegrass song
	- I really love that chord progression, especially during the chorus
	- Wow, a fiddle solo! Can't say I've seen one of those yet
	- When those drums kick in, it turns it into one hell of a funky song
	- Nice acapella outro
	
11. "My Eyes Adored You" - Frankie Valli

	- Song about a hopeless romantic
	- The lyrics are so on-the-nose that it would be hard miss
	- Valli even flexes his fortune and fame for a verse; wow, soooo cool
	- Needless key change; you can tell when they've run out ideas to spice up a song when they do that

12. "Lady Marmalade" - Labelle

	- Funky song about a prostitute
	- I like the "go sister, go!" bit by the backing vocals
	- Wow, first time I've heard french lyrics since the Singing Nun
	- It's a good song; but I can't say it's anything too special
	
13. "Lovin' You" - Minnie Riperton

	- Slow, boring love song
	- Plain lyrics, very low-effort "la la la la"
	- Riperton is needlessly hitting high notes on a song that really isn't interesting enough to warrant it
	
14. "Philidelphia Freedom" - The Elton John Band

	- Elton John's attempt to capitalize on the Philidelphia Soul sound
	- Honestly, it's really not that good. I mean, it's not bad, but it's just too plain
	- Also this song really should only be like 2 and a half minutes long; it's way too long
	
15. "(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song" - B. J. Thomas

	- Hey, I think the song title isn't long enough
	- Real one-note song; nothing all that interesting about it
	- I guess it has a nice bouncy quality to it, that's about it
	
16. "He Don't Love You (Like I Love You)" - Tony Orlando & Dawn

	- Another plain love song; easily confused with many others like it
	
17. "Shining Star" - Earth, Wind & Fire

	- You know, I've always thought Earth, Wind & Fire was the better funk band of the '70s
	- All of the instruments come together to create something space-age about this groove
	- That little shred guitar solo in the middle is awesome
	- Amazing vocals and lyrics; very positive!
	
18. "Before the Next Teardrop Falls" - Freddy Fender

	- A nice little slow Tejano song
	- Wow, I really like this; I think Fender's voice is great and it's neat to hear some Spainsh lyrics in a pop song

19. "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" - John Denver

	- A very upbeat folk/bluegrass song
	- Great and funny lyrics; well-performed especially with those backing vocals
	- Outstanding fiddle and banjo solos throughout
	
20. "Sister Golden Hair" - America

	- This is what The Eagles wish they sounded like
	- Just a great folk rock song; everyone's performance is outstanding
	
21. "Love Will Keep Us Together" - Captain & Tennille

	- This song sounds like all of the instruments are Fisher-Price toy instruments XD
	- It's a nice upbeat song; but I can't say it's anything too special
	
22. "Listen to What The Man Said" - Paul McCartney & Wings

	- Besides the trotting-horse rhythm and tenor sax; it's a really one-note song
	- I guess I like that slow outro
	
23. "The Hustle" - Van McCoy & The Soul City Symphony
	
	- Disco pseudo-instrumental
	- I like the piccolo lead; it's a little tacky but it has a charm to it
	- The horn section is also pretty good too!
	- Overall, it's a nice little instrumental; although nothing too special
	
24. "One of These Nights" - The Eagles

	- The Eagles go disco!
	- I love that bass line in the intro; real good!
	- I also love that tone on the lead guitar; very unique!
	- Great guitar work by Don Felder on this track
	- Honestly, as hilarious as it is to see a rock band do a straight-disco song, it's actually not half-bad

25. "Jive Talkin'" - Bee Gees
	
	- First Disco #1 hit by the Bee Gees
	- I really like the use of the analog synth on this track; really makes it stand out from everything else
	- The little synth bit after each chorus is great
	
26. "Fallin' in Love" - Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds

	- Real boring, one-note love song; sometimes soft rock can be a little too soft.
	
27. "Get Down Tonight" - KC and the Sunshine Band

	- One of the most disco sounding songs I've ever heard
	- The sped-up guitar track is an interesting idea, and it sounds pretty good to be honest
	- Kind of a catchy chorus, but really only something I'd only like to hear at a disco/club
	
28. "Rhinestone Cowboy" - Glen Campbell

	- Pop-country song
	- The chorus ain't half-bad!
	- It's a nice song, but I really don't think it's anything special
	
29. "Fame" - David Bowie

	- As a big fan of Bowie, I just want to mention that this song is far from representative of his sound. He can be pretty "out there" with his music
	- That back-masked intro is just great!
	- It's funny how distinctly Bowie this sounds despite being a straight-funk song
	- I like this one; it's like a much gritter and rough sounding disco track compared to everything else coming out at the time
	
	
30. "I'm Sorry" - John Denver

	- Folk ballad
	- It's well-done; good chord progression
	- A little to mopey for my liking; but Denver's talent is undisputed here
	
31. "Bad Blood" - Neil Sedaka

	- I like the bass on this one; sounds real meaty
	- A bit more upbeat then his other songs
	- Not much else I can say; it's a decent song

32. "Island Girl" - Elton John

	- Insanely good groove with the bass and drums
	- Maybe the marimba is a little too tacky for my tastes
	- I like the slide electric-guitar after the choruses; sounds good and goes well with the bass and drums
	- Not a half-bad song
	
33. "That's the Way (I Like It)" - KC & The Sunshine Band

	- I like the call-response chorus line, but it can be a little repetitive
	- Besides the main-line, it really does sound just like their last hit

34. "Fly, Robin, Fly" - Silver Convention

	- Ooh, some GERMAN disco
	- I really like that main bass line; sounds real tough
	- As good and groovy as the song is, it drags on for waaaayyy too long
	
35. "Let's Do It Again" - The Staple Singers

	- Funk song written for the film of the same name
	- As nice and laid back as the song is, it's nothing too special

34. "My Eyes Adored You" - Frankie Valli
35. "Lovin' You" - Minnie Riperton

Very similar to last year; another "meh" year. Disco has now been firmly planted into the charts, and it looks like there's no stopping it. Kinda wishing we were already into the post-disco era, as I always thought that what was inspired by disco was always better than disco itself.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1976
----

1. "Saturday Night" - Bay City Rollers

	- '50s Rock N' Roll throwback song
	- The "S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... hey!" bit is kind of catchy
	- Either than that, it's an okay song
	
2. "Convoy" - C.W. McCall

	- Novelty country song about truck drivers
	- The chorus is catchy, but the high-pitched backup singers DO NOT fit the theme AT ALL; It's a country song, not a disco song
	- It's a funny song, you can tell they weren't taking it too seriously
	
3. "I Write the Songs" - Barry Manilow

	- "Mr. Manilow, you claim to WRITE the songs, yet you are singing a song written by someone else! Curious!"
	- Okay, besides that lame joke, it's not a half-bad ballad. It's kind of a stock ballad, but I've heard worse

4. "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)" - Diana Ross

	- Theme song for the film of the same name
	- Meh, just a plain boring song; really nothing exciting about this one at all
	
5. "Love Rollercoaster" - Ohio Players

	- Damn, that's one funky guitar riff!
	- Good backing vocals on this one
	- The song kind of drags on for 5 minutes, but then again this was made for the disco/club
	
6. "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" - Paul Simon
	
	- Nice marching cadence to the song
	- Interesting chord progression; quite unconventional
	- The chorus is nice and funky
	- Funny lyrics
	
7. "Theme from S.W.A.T." - Rhythm Heritage

	- Instrumental theme for the TV Series of the same name
	- Insanely funky; that chord progression on piano is fantastic
	- The little breakdown in the middle with the bass is too damn good 

8. "Love Machine Pt. 1" - The Miracles

	- The main riff during the chorus is just great
	- Vocals are pretty good; especially during the chorus
	- Solid song; nothing to complain about
	
9. "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)" - Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons

	- You know this one's not half bad; I guess you could say that these guys do disco better than doo-wop
	- Frankie actually sounds better when singing in this range; a lot better than his performance on "Big Girls Don't Cry"
	- The main riff is nice and upbeat
	
10. "Disco Lady" - Johnnie Taylor

	- It's an okay disco song; it's probably the most stock-sounding disco song I've ever heard
	- The lyrics are so hilariously suggestive; I can't help but laugh at how silly they are
	
11. "Let Your Love Flow" - The Bellamy Brothers

	- A nice upbeat pop-country song
	- Amazing chord progression
	- Very cheery lyrics; very singable
	- One of the best choruses I've heard so far

12. "Welcome Back (Theme from Welcome Back, Kotter) - John Sebastian

	- Wow, 2 TV themes in one year? What a bargin!
	- It's a nice upbeat, cheery song
	- Maybe it's a little "too" cheery; it's kind of creepy how happy this sounds
	- Nice little blues harp solo in the middle
	
13. "Boogie Fever" - The Sylvers

	- Nice analog synth and guitar main riff
	- Really silly lyrics, but it's whatever
	- "Doing the bump, bump, bump!" bit is kind of catchy
	
14. "Silly Love Songs" - Paul McCartney & Wings

	- I really like the industrial park sounds in the beginning; kind of jarring but in a good way
	- Great bass on this track; stands out in the front of the mix
	- The horn section is on point; really good!
	- The backing vocals really compliment the track well
	
15. "Love Hangover" - Diana Ross

	- Has a nice drum groove
	- The vocals are just too breathy and weird sounding
	- I kind of like how the song picks up the pace in the middle; makes a bit more funky
	- Either than that; nothing too special
	
16. "Afternoon Delight" - Starland Vocal Band

	- Pop-country song
	- Nice vocal harmony throughout
	- It's a decent song; not bad
	
17. "Kiss and Say Goodbye" - The Manhattans

	- The spoken-word intro is just soooo melodramatic and boring
	- The main vocals are pretty decent; fits the groove well enough
	
18. "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" - Elton John & Kiki Dee

	- Nice little funky duet
	- John and Dee sound pretty good together here
	- Nice chorus; very upbeat
	- Good instrumentation all throughout; top notch production quality
	
19. "You Should Be Dancing" - Bee Gees

	- You know, when the Bee Gees go all-out with disco, they really do sound good
	- There's a nice sense of urgency with the song; a perfect fit for a disco/club
	- One hell of a guitar solo in the middle
	
20. "(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty" - KC & The Sunshine Band

	- It's like every hit song these guys had, they just slightly changed how the last one went and called it a day
	- It crazy how similar all of there songs sound

21. "Play That Funky Music" - Wild Cherry

	- It's like they set out to write the funkiest song, and managed to do it
	- That main riff on bass is great
	- Awesome guitar solo!
	
22. "A Fifth of Beethoven" - Walter Murphy & The Big Apple Band

	- Discofied version of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5
	- It's not like bad or anything, but they must've been high when they came up with this idea
	
23. "Disco Duck" - Rick Dees & His Cast of Idiots

	- Novelty song satirizing disco
	- Okay, THESE people must of been high when they came up with this idea
	- I can't say I like the "duck" vocals; I mean they tried, but it's sounds horrible
	- I guess since it's a parody, I can't hate it all that much
	
24. "If You Leave Me Now" - Chicago

	- Soft rock song
	- I've always kind of liked Chicago; they are quite a talented group
	- Even though this song is as perdictable as many other soft rock songs, I do thing this one's got a special charm to it
	- I really like the little acoustic guitar bits throughout
	
25. "Rock'n Me" - Steve Miller Band

	- Nice, bluesy hard rock song
	- Lyrics have a nice rhythmic quality to them; I like it
	- I'm just thankful that we got some bluey music this year

	- Has a nice sax solo in the middle
	- It's a decent song; nothing too special about it

This was not a good year. There really wasn't anything that stood out; everything was just kind of bland and boring this year. Some good stuff here and there, but even then it's a far-cry to some of the previous year's stuff.

2. "You Don't Have to Be a Star (To Be in My Show)" - Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr.

	- Mid-tempo disco duet
	- The two are really good singers; happy for them having been married for over 50 years
	- I like the little vocal bits in the middle; well harmonized
	- It's not bad; it's done well enough but it's nothing too special
	
3. "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing" - Leo Sayer

	- Cheery disco song
	- This dude's got one hell of a falsetto
	- Chorus is catchy enough

4. "I Wish" - Stevie Wonder

	- Insanely upbeat funk song
	- The tambre of the synth, electric piano, and bass being played together is pure ecstacy

	- That chorus is so powerful!

5. "Car Wash" - Rose Royce

	- That bass intro with those little guitar stabs are fantastic!
	- Great chorus; very singable
	- Besides that, the song is funky but it's nothing too special
	
6. "Torn Between Two Lovers" - Mary MacGregor

	- Soft pop-rock song about a love triangle
	- The vocal performance here is putting me to sleep; no real passion at all
	- Also, the production quality is garbage; it sounds like it was recorded from an AM radio station
	
7. "Blinded by the Light" - Manfred Mann's Earth Band

	- Rock song written by Bruce Springsteen
	- Great electric organ work on this one
	- Okay, does anybody know what this song's about? The lyrics are so incoherent, I have no clue
	- I guess if you rock hard enough, your song doesn't have to make sense! XD
	
8. "New Kid in Town" - The Eagles

	- Slow soft rock song
	- Great guitar lead guitar work throughout the song
	- Nice outro; the vocals are pretty good
	- It's a well-done song, but it's just a little boring for my liking
	
9. "Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star is Born)" - Barbra Streisand

	- Love ballad
	- I like the arpeggiated chords on the acoustic guitar; much better than most other ballads I've heard so far
	- Streisand's vocals on this one pretty good; a nice wide range also!
	- Not half bad; I was expecting a slow, sappy, ballad but it actually sounds pretty good
	
10. "Rich Girl" - Daryl Hall & John Oates

	- Nice chorus; fits well with the electric piano chords
	- First time I've heard the word "bitch" in a #1 hit; can't wait until we get to the 2010s!
	- Nice little mid-tempo funky song; I like it
	
11. "Dancing Queen" - ABBA

	- Europop disco song
	- Somehow one of the better disco groups came from Sweden of all places
	- Amazing vocal performance and instrumentation; it just radiates wonder
	- Honestly, this is just a great song; it's probably the closest thing to a "perfect" disco song
	
12. "Don't Give Up on Us" - David Soul

	- Soft rock piano ballad
	- Largely forgettable; It's pretty much indistinguishable from everything else so far
	
13. "Don't Leave Me This Way" - Thelma Houston

	- Originally going to be a Diana Ross song, but was assigned to Houston
	- The chorus is actually pretty good; better than Diana Ross' other songs so far honestly
	- Actually, after thinking about it, I think I like Houston's voice better than Ross' O_O
	
14. "Southern Nights" - Glen Campbell

	- Pop-country song; has a bit of a ragtimey feel to it

	- Slow love song
	- Chorus is pretty good
	- A nice pleasant sax solo as well
	- Not half-bad honestly
	
17. "Sir Duke" - Stevie Wonder

	- Amazing horn section on this one
	- The decending bit right before the chorus is amazing
	- The chorus is the kind of thing that brightens up your day no matter what
	
18. "I'm Your Boogie Man" - KC & The Sunshine Band

	- I'm honestly impressed. They've managed to write a song that sounds distinct from their other hits!
	- Those horns are fantastic; sounds bad-ass!
	- Also an awesome chorus as well; "I'm your boogie man, boogie man..."
	- Oooooh, that little guitar and piano solo in the middle is great!
	
19. "Dreams" - Fleetwood Mac

	- That foreboding bass line... chilling
	- Those fade-in guitar notes throughout the whole song are just ethreal... amazing
	- Those haunting vocals from Stevie Nicks are just perfect
	- When those backing vocals come in during the chorus; it just sends the song into the clouds
	- If you haven't heard the album "Rumours" yet, you need to do that; amazing album
	
20. "Got To Give It Up Pt. 1" - Marvin Gaye

	- An amazing funky R&B song; even this late in the game, Marvin Gaye still had it!
	- I actually like how it mixed to sound like it's being recorded at a house party
	- It's not a song that takes itself too seriously; it's just a solid grove!

21. "Gonna Fly Now (Theme From Rocky)" - Bill Conti

	- Philly soul song written for the boxing film Rocky
	- Those horns drive the song like a Mack Truck
	- When the backing vocals come in, it elevates the song so well
	- There's even a damn good guitar solo in the middle too!
	
22. "Undercover Angel" - Alan O'Day

	- This is such a tacky song; the call-response bit before the chorus sounds like it's ripped straight from a parody song
	- The reverb on the vocals really drive home the tackyness of the song
	- There's even some Fisher-Price toy instruments in it too!
	
23. "Da Doo Ron Ron" - Shaun Cassidy

	- Cover of an old doo-wop R&B song from 1963
	- Honestly, the '70s production quality makes it sound like a lame ass karaoke cover
	
24. "Looks Like We Made It" - Barry Manilow

	- Slow piano ballad
	- It's at least one notch better than Manilow's other ballads, I think
	- ...but they just had to throw in a needless key change near the end
	
25. "I Just Want to Be Your Everything" - Andy Gibb

	- Hey, everyone look! It's the Bee Gees Jr. (literally the younger brother of the two Gibb brothers in the Bee Gees)!
	- Joking aside, this is actually a pretty solid disco song
	- Andy Gibb gives a pretty good vocal performace on this song
	- It's surprisingly restrained for a disco song; it doesn't go too overboard (besides maybe the string section)
	
26. "Best of My Love" - The Emotions

	- A nice little upbeat funky/disco song
	- It's a well-done song and it's catchy and all, but the fact that it's overplayed on the radio just kills it for me
	
27. "Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band" - Meco

	- "Hey, let's take two most popular things in America, Star Wars and disco, and combined them!" The Song
	- Somehow it actually manages to sound pretty good
	- I just noticed that my song-progress bar on my Spotify is a lightsaber XD Neat little easter egg!
	- Honestly, I think the Cantina Band part of the medley is the better half
	
28. "You Light Up My Life" - Debby Boone

	- #1 for 10 consectutive weeks, beating the record held by "Hey Jude" by the Beatles by one week
	- Really? I'm disappointed in you 1977 America; this is NOT the "Hey Jude" killer it should have been!
	- Just a slow, boring love song; it's not terrible, but it's far from something legendary
	
29. "How Deep Is Your Love" - Bee Gees

	- Slow soft rock ballad
	- This actually pretty good; the vocals are fantastic throughout; especially during the chorus
	- Those synth chords are just nice and pleasant to listen to

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1978
----

1. "How Deep Is Your Love" - Bee Gees

	- Slow soft rock ballad
	- This actually pretty good; the vocals are fantastic throughout; especially during the chorus
	- Those synth chords are just nice and pleasant to listen to

2. "Baby Come Back" - Player

	- A nice smooth sounding funk/soft rock song
	- That straight beat on drums plus that bass line is great
	- Great guitar work throughout

3. "Stayin' Alive" - Bee Gees

	- Great bass line; very iconic
	- The vocals on the chorus have a nice rhythmic quality to it; I like it
	- It's a good song; I would probably like this song more if it wasn't overplayed on the radio

4. "(Love Is) Thicker Than Water" - Andy Gibb

	- Two Bee Gees hits in a row! (Well, kind of)
	- Has nice chorus
	- That little guitar solo in the middle is quite pleasant to listen to
	- Not a half bad song; can't say it's anything special
	
5. "Night Fever" - Bee Gees

	- Bee Gees biggest hit, 8 weeks at #1 and 13 weeks in the top 10
	- Has a nice bouncy feel to it; very well-done
	- Favorite part is the post-chrous bit; kind of sounds heavy
	- Can't say much else, just a solid song
	
6. "If I Can't Have You" - Yvonne Elliman

	- Oh wow, this was written by the Bee Gees also, that makes 5 Bee Gees hits out of 6 so far this year!
	- Maybe it's worth mentioning that all of these songs were in Saturday Night Fever...
	- This one's alright; it's not half-bad, but it ain't anything too special
	
7. "With a Little Luck" - Paul McCartney & Wings

	- I have no clue how Paul had so many hits with his band Wings, they are so hit-or-miss...
	- This one's a miss for me, way to plain and boring for my liking
	
8. "Too Much, Too Little, Too Late" - Johnny Mathis & Deniece Williams

	- R&B duet
	- Honestly, this one's just lame; I can't say I like Williams voice.
	
9. "You're the One That I Want" - John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John

	- Song from the movie Grease
	- It's nice and upbeat enough
	- It's very clear that Travolta is not a singer and Newton-John is; it's night-and-day
	- Another okay song; it's catchy but nothing too special
	
10.	"Shadow Dancing" - Andy Gibb

	- Wow, a minor-key disco song; sounds gritty
	- Real funky chorus; I like it
	- Just a solid funk/disco song; better than the other Bee Gees songs I think
	
11. "Miss You" - The Rolling Stones

	- Hard Rock/Disco song
	- Great instrumentation throughout; especially the sax solo towards the end
	- Honestly, it's just an okay song; They do a good job of combining their sound with disco, but they can only go so far with it

12. "Three Times A Lady" - The Commodores

	- Slow piano ballad; first #1 hit for Lionel Ritchie
	- I always thoughout the chorus was funny to listen to: "once... twice... three times a laaaddddy"
	- It's not half-bad; it manages to be a real slow song and NOT put me to sleep. Good job, Lionel!
	
13. "Grease" - Frankie Valli

	- Another song from the film Grease... well it is the title track after all
	- I really like that chorus the way the backing vocals play off the vocals from Valli is good
	- Honestly, Frankie Valli is a surprising case where a pop star gets better as their career goes on; his voice has gotten much better since the doo-wop days

14. "Boogie Oogie Oogie" - A Taste of Honey

	- Amazing guitar and bass on this one; the two female singers are actually the ones playing!
	- It's great to see a disco artist play to the strengths of the genre; it's like they set out to make a banger

15. "Kiss You All Over" - Exile

	- Mid-tempo rock song
	- Nice synth chord-progression
	- I like the little guitar bits throughout
	- Not a half-bad song
	
16. "Hot Child in the City" - Nick Gilder

	- Power pop-rock song
	- Sounds like a poppier version of David Bowie; I kind of like it
	- Neat chorus; I like those little synth chords
	- Nice guitar work throughout the song
	
17. "You Needed Me" - Anne Murray

	- Soft love ballad
	- It's just a "meh" song; it's one of the most plain songs I've ever heard
	
18. "MacArthur Park" - Donna Summer

	- Disco cover of an orchestral pop song from 1967
	- I kind of like how it starts off slow but then get's faster after a minute or so
	- The song's urgency feels kinda forced; I actually think it would be better slower
	- Besides Summer's amazing vocal range, the song is just "alright"
	
19. "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" - Barbra Streisand & Neil Diamond

	- Love ballad duet
	- The performances are very good, but the song itself is kind of "meh"
	
20. "Le Freak" - Chic
	
	- The single greatest funk guitar riff ever written; Nile Rodgers is the king
	- Fun Fact: They originally wanted the refrain to be "Fuck Off!" but had to settle for "Freak Out!" for it to be radio-friendly
	- Let's also not ignore the fantastic bass and drums on this song as well
	- This otherwise be just an okay song if it weren't for the amazing instrumentation

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Boogie Oogie Oogie" - A Taste of Honey
2. "Hot Child in the City" - Nick Gilder
3. "Le Freak" - Chic
4. "Baby Come Back" - Player
5. "Shadow Dancing" - Andy Gibb
6. "Night Fever" - Bee Gees
7. "How Deep Is Your Love" - Bee Gees
8. "Grease" - Frankie Valli

17. "You're the One That I Want" - John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John
18. "With a Little Luck" - Paul McCartney & Wings
19. "You Needed Me" - Anne Murray
20. "Too Much, Too Little, Too Late" - Johnny Mathis & Deniece Williams

This was the single greatest "meh" year so far, and I don't mean that to be derogatory; it was really just super-average. This is the first year where none of the songs were added to my Best or Worst #1 hits list (which you'll get to see when I'm finished). That's how average this year was. Besides that, I think this was the best year for disco as a whole, but that's not saying much since, as a genre, I don't think it's all that great to begin with. I just can't wait for the '80s to show up already so I can move on.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1979
----

1. "Too Much Heaven" - Bee Gees

	- Slow soft-rock song
	- Good vocal harmony during the chorus
	- It's not bad, but I think of it as lesser follow-up to "How Deep Is Your Love"

2. "Le Freak" - Chic
	
	- The single greatest funk guitar riff ever written; Nile Rodgers is the king
	- Fun Fact: They originally wanted the refrain to be "Fuck Off!" but had to settle for "Freak Out!" for it to be radio-friendly
	- Let's also not ignore the fantastic bass and drums on this song as well
	- This otherwise be just an okay song if it weren't for the amazing instrumentation
	
3. "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" - Rod Stewart

	- Has a nice gallop-rhythm; haven't seen a lot of that
	- Even a pretty decent synth main-riff as well
	- Did any ladies back in day ACTUALLY think Rod Stewart was sexy? Looking at pictures of him from 1979, he looks as washed-up and aged as any rock star would TWENTY years after their last success, but this was when he was still relevant

4. "I Will Survive" - Gloria Gaynor

	- A neat little premise for a disco song and it's well-done for the most part
	- Another case of "overplayed on the radio"; I wish I could like it more but I just can't

5. "Tragedy" - Bee Gees

	- Another minor-key Bee Gees song
	- This one's a bit more rock than disco which is kind of a nice bit of change for a disco group
	- I can't help but think they were creating this epic, larger-than-life song, but I'm just not feeling it

6. "What a Fool Believes" - The Doobie Brothers

	- Song sung by keyboardist of the band, Michael McDonald
	- I always thought this song was kinda ahead of it's time in that each section of the song sounds like it's own song
	- As much of a straight Yacht Rock song it is, I have a soft-spot for this one; it's just a great song and McDonald's performance is outstanding

7. "Knock on Wood" - Amii Stewart

	- Nice use of a drum machine on this one; almost like it could have been made in the '80s
	- This also has a gallop-rhythm as well, I guess this was the year that it became trendy
	- It's an okay song, it kinda just drags on; the only part I think is good is the backing vocals in the middle and at the end

8. "Heart of Glass" - Blondie

	- Our first New Wave #1 hit; a sign of what's to come in the '80s
	- I like the distinct drum machine loop running throughout the whole song
	- Blondie's voice during the chorus is pretty good, not so much during the verses; I just think it's a bit overdone
	- It's a good song and a nice break from the more straight-disco stuff, but it's nothing too special; far from their best stuff

9. "Reunited" - Peaches & Herb

	- Slow jazzy R&B duet
	- Both the vocals and instrumentation are surprisingly smooth-sounding
	- It's pleasant to listen to, but it's way too long at almost 6 minutes
	
10. "Hot Stuff" - Donna Summer

	- Nice little rock/disco crossover
	- Great guitar solo from Steely Dan guitarist, Jeff "Skunk" Baxter
	- It's nice and upbeat; but there's not much too it other than the crossover aspects of it
	
11. "Love You Inside Out" - Bee Gees

	- The Bee Gees last #1 hit song; ending their disco reign over the charts
	- Now this is a Bee Gees song I NEVER hear on the radio; that's a first...
	- That's probably for a reason; this is just a "meh" song. I feel like they phoned this one in
	
12. "Ring My Bell" - Anita Ward

	- Very upbeat disco song
	- That little "booooooh" sound effect is just distracting and tacky as hell
	- Either than that, it's not a half-bad disco song; nice instrumentation and harmonies
	
13. "Bad Girls" - Donna Summer

	- Very guitar-driven disco song about prostitutes
	- As silly as the "Toot toot! Hey, beep beep!" refrain is, I like it
	- Good use of horns on this song throughout
	- Overall, a pretty good song
	
14. "Good Times" - Chic

	- The return the the funk guitar king, Nile Rodgers
	- A nice use of both piano and stings throughout the song
	- Fun Fact: this was sampled in the first Rap hit-song, "Rapper's Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang in the same year

15. "My Sharona" - The Knack

	- Hard rock song about jailbait (What? that's what this song is about)
	- One of the best guitar riffs of all time; simple, yet very effective at making you wanna jump through a brick wall
	- My God, the way that the drums, bass, and guitar play together during the verses are just perfection
	- Not just one, but TWO absolute banger guitar solos, the second one is probably my favorite guitar solo from a #1 hit song
	- I cannot understate how hard this song ROCKS, it's THE prime example of how to combine hard rock with pop-senseabilities

16. "Sad Eyes" - Robert John

	- Slow pop song that is, believe it or not, is NOT a disco song
	- I like how the vocals are well-harmonized throughout the whole song
	- I really like the chorus; it's very well done
	
17. "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" - Michael Jackson

	- Here we are at the first #1 from Michael Jackson as an adult; the start of his reign over the '80s
	- Honestly, the spoken-word intro is so hilarious. It's like he's trying to sound sensual, but he just sounds like a little kid
	- He's got a pretty good falsetto, but I'm glad he sang in a lower range for most of his future hits; suits him better
	- Catchy chorus; very singable
	
18. "Rise" - Herb Alpert

	- Jazzy, funk rock instrumental
	- Fun Fact: Herb Alpert is the only artist to have an instrumental and a song with vocals reach #1
	- Man, Herb really is a great trumpter; I guess that was always his strong suit
	- Just a great instrumental; well-done overall
	
19. "Pop Muzik" - M

	- First synth-pop #1 hit; kind of an experimental song as well
	- The project is literally just the letter "M"; didn't know you could do that
	- You know, for an early attempt at synth-pop, it's actually well-done; funny lyrics, good cadence, good instrumentation that doesn't sound tacky at all. I'm impressed

20. "Heartache Tonight" - The Eagles

	- Country/Blue Rock song co-written by Bob Seger; the kind of beer-drinkin' song your dad listens to
	- I'm surprised that The Eagles made such a simple song; hardly anything complicated about this one
	- Some pretty solid slide-guitar in this song
	- Not half-bad; just a solid blues rock song
	
21. "Still" - The Commodores

	- Slow R&B ballad
	- Lionel Ritchie's voice is good on this song, but that's about the only thing worth mentioning; it's just such a plain song

22. "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)" - Barbra Streisand & Donna Summer

	- Disco duet; Didn't think I'd see Streisand go disco
	- Nursery rhymes in the beginning? Kind of tacky
	- I think this is the most jarring slow-to-fast transition I've heard so far; it was so slow at first, but then it got REAL fast REAL quick
	- I mean it's nothing too special, but at least it's really fast, makes up for it

23. "Babe" - Styx

	- Soft rock piano ballad
	- Really nice twinkly piano keys in the beginning
	- Solid vocal performance from Dennis DeYoung
	- The transition into the guitar solo is a little sudden; maybe they could have eased into it a bit better
	- Another soft-spot song for me, something about it is just great, but I can't put my finger on it

24. "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" - Rupert Holmes

	- Last song to reach #1 in the '70s, so let's end it with some yacht rock!
	- The song's about a guy who starts an affair with a mystery woman in the classifieds
	- ...but SURPRISE! It was his wife he was trying to hookup with in the classifieds ALL ALONG!
	- I guess if you both cheat on each other with yourselves, that's okay and won't tank your marriage AT ALL, I'm sure
	- I mean, did they EVER talk about anything with each other AT ALL during their whole marriage? it took them this long to discover each other?
	- Either than that, it's a decent song; It's actually surprisingly down-to-earth. The characters aren't rockstars with larger-than-life personalities, but instead just regular people

OVERALL RANKING

1. "My Sharona" - The Knack
2. "Babe" - Styx
3. "What a Fool Believes" - The Doobie Brothers

21. "Still" - The Commodores
22. "Reunited" - Peaches & Herb
23. "Love You Inside Out" - Bee Gees
24. "Knock on Wood" - Amii Stewart

Okay, so that was the '70s. Some good, but a lot of "meh" to straight-up bad. If anyone is nostalgic for the disco era, I'm not going to take that away from you, that's your's to keep, but I just don't see it as anything else but a musical junk food. Hey, but I guess I'm not one to talk since I like a lot of junk food music as well. Anyway, I'm glad we've made it to the '80s, as I do already like a lot of pop stuff from this decade. Can't wait to see what's in store!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1980
----

1. "Please Don't Go" - KC & The Sunshine Band

	- Slow soft rock ballad
	- The main synth line is pleasant
	- I like how the songs picks up towards the end
	- Honestly, not a bad attempt for a slow song by a disco-only band

2. "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" - Rupert Holmes

	- Last song to reach #1 in the '70s, so let's end it with some yacht rock!
	- The song's about a guy who starts an affair with a mystery woman in the classifieds
	- ...but SURPRISE! It was his wife he was trying to hookup with in the classifieds ALL ALONG!
	- I guess if you both cheat on each other with yourselves, that's okay and won't tank your marriage AT ALL, I'm sure
	- I mean, did they EVER talk about anything with each other AT ALL during their whole marriage? it took them this long to discover each other?
	- Either than that, it's a decent song; It's actually surprisingly down-to-earth. The characters aren't rockstars with larger-than-life personalities, but instead just regular people

3. "Rock with You" - Michael Jackson

	- Insanely good groove throughout the whole song; top notch
	- Michael's vocal performance is really good; not overdone and even the backing vocals are on point
	- That little synth line after the bridge is outstanding
	
4. "Do That To Me One More Time" - Captain & Tennille

	- Slow yacht rock ballad
	- This is one of my biggest problems with the many attempts of yacht rock; it's like they are trying to be slow, dreamy, and ethereal, but most of the time, it just comes off as tacky public access stock music
	
5. "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" - Queen

	- Rockabilly song
	- Not really in Queen's wheelhouse, but they pull it off pretty good
	- Very catchy; a testament of their ability as performers
	
6. "Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2" - Pink Floyd

	- Concept album prog rock song
	- Wait? WHAT?! Okay, like the song "Frankenstein", America just decided they liked prog rock all of a sudden
	- Insanely funky and catchy
	- Very anthemic as well "We don't need no education! We don't need no thought control!"
	- Absolutely amazing guitar solo at the end!
	- Honestly, I love this song to death, but it feels really weird to listen to without the two songs that precide it: "Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 1" and "The Happiest Days of our Lives". This song's a part of the concept album "The Wall". Listening to the song isolated like this just feels wrong. If you haven't listened to "The Wall" from front to back, or seen the film that goes with it, you really need to. It's insanely trippy and quite the experience
	
7. "Call Me" - Blondie

	- Upbeat new wave song
	- Okay, THIS is how you do a song!
	- That galloping riff is just outstanding
	- An amazing chorus; that call-response bit "Call Me! (Call Me!)" is phenomenal
	- Hell, even the french-lyric bridge is neat; plus an amazing keyboard solo!
	
8. "Funkytown" - Lipps Inc.

	- Funk song; I mean, it's in the title
	- I mean, it really is a funky song; hard to not bob your head to it
	- I really wish I could say more; it's just a really good funk song. It really is something that explains itself when you listen to it

9. "Coming Up" - Paul McCartney

	- Live version of the song that when to #1
	- Probably the fastest Paul has ever played; it helps too, as the speed of the song fits the funk rock feel real well
	- It's not a half-bad song, but it does kind of drag on despite only being 4 minutes long
	
10. "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me" - Billy Joel

	- A nice little rockabilly song
	- Very funny lyrics, but in good way; it's very light-hearted
	- Great sax solo in the middle
	- Just a real well-done song; great performance
	
11. "Magic" - Olivia Newton-John

	- Has a very interesting chord progression; the guitar has some kind of "chorus effect" on it
	- They did a realy good job of making the song "magical" sounding; props to the producers
	- I think this song suits Newton-John's vocals much better than her previous #1 hits
	- Not half-bad; I guess the '80s sound really worked to her advantage
	
12. "Sailing" - Christopher Cross

	- Hey! A fellow musician from San Antonio, Texas!
	- An amazing string intro; fading well into the guitar and drums
	- THAT guitar riff... and that TONE... absolutely amazing
	- Very pleasant bridge; nice piano
	- THIS song was the peak of yacht rock; it did what every other attempt couldn't do, which was to embody the dreamy, ethereal feeling of... well... sailing

13. "Upside Down" - Diana Ross

	- Wow, I guess knowing that the dude is cheating on you isn't enough for you to want to dump him since "no one makes [you] feel like [he does]"
	- It's got a nice bit of funk to it; but I think it's boring and overplayed on the radio

14. "Another One Bites The Dust" - Queen

	- There is no bass line on earth that makes one feel as badass as this one
	- Those reverse fade-in piano chords are amazing
	- Also amazing funky guitar bits by Brian May
	- Let's also take a moment to appreciate Freddie Mercury's vocals; absolutely outstanding here
	
15. "Woman in Love" - Barbra Streisand

	- Honestly, just a lame slow, soft ballad; It could have been so much more but it's so plain
	- I guess the chorus is kind of good; it's got a nice vocal harmony
	
16. "Lady" - Kenny Rogers

	- Song written by Lionel Ritchie
	- Another slow and boring song; I have a feeling it would have been better had Ritchie keep it for himself

17. "(Just Like) Starting Over" - John Lennon

	- Another posthumous #1 hit; just two weeks after Lennon's murder
	- It's like a rockabilly song kind of; definitely John trying to emulate the kind of music he grew up listening to
	- Not a half bad song; it's a damn shame his life was cut so short. I imagine he would have made some good tunes during the '80s

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1981
----

1. "(Just Like) Starting Over" - John Lennon

	- Another posthumous #1 hit; just two weeks after Lennon's murder
	- It's like a rockabilly song kind of; definitely John trying to emulate the kind of music he grew up listening to
	- Not a half bad song; it's a damn shame his life was cut so short. I imagine he would have made some good tunes during the '80s

2. "The Tide Is High" - Blondie

	- Reggae/ska song
	- A complete departure from their typical sound
	- Horn section sounds good
	- It's not half bad; it sounds good and all but it's nothing too special

3. "Celebration" - Kool & The Gang

	- Upbeat funk song about a celebration!
	- Very catchy and singable
	- The lyrics are pretty simple but the instrumentation does good conveying the cheery mood of the song

4. "9 to 5" - Dolly Parton

	- Pop-country song about the daily grind
	- I don't know... sounds like COMMIE propaganda to me! Am I listening to Karl Marx or Dolly Parton?
	- In all seriousness, it's a pretty solid song; her voice is great and extremely catchy

5. "I Love a Rainy Night" - Eddie Rabbitt

	- A swingy rockabilly song
	- Real good chorus; very catchy
	- I'm so glad that the production quality of your standard pop music has increased so much to the point that even a standard song like this one sounds good

6. "Keep On Loving You" - REO Speedwagon

	- First power ballad to reach #1; this will be a common occurance this decade...
	- Really good piano and vocals on this one
	- Very powerful chorus
	- Another soft-spot song for me; It just sounds great but I can't figure out why
	
7. "Rapture" - Blondie

	- It's like a weird combination of New wave, Funk, and Hip Hop
	- I never would have guessed the first Rap song to reach #1 would have been a white girl...
	- ...and it's absolutely garbage. It's like she's trying to freestyle the first words to come to her head and because of that, she's rapping about Martians coming down to Earth to eat cars and then she gets transformed into one of the car-eaters
	- Besides, that the chorus is really good and there's even a banger guitar solo towards the end but it can't make up for the terrible rapping

8. "Kiss on My List" - Daryl Hall & John Oates

	- Nice little drum machine in the background
	- The pre-chorus and chorus are pretty good; Hall & Oates really were made to harmonize with one another
	- A very fitting guitar solo too; another amazing guitar tone as well!
	
9. "Morning Train (Nine to Five)" - Sheena Easton

	- Wow, TWO songs with the same name go to #1 within the same year; what a coincidence!
	- Eh, it's okay; I guess you could say this would be the first "meh" song with the '80s sound to reach #1

10. "Bette Davis Eyes" - Kim Carnes

	- Okay, this song REEKS of '80s; everything from the synth lines to the over-reverbed production is so '80s
	- That main synth is great; throughout the whole song it just fits so well
	- Carnes has a very distinct raspy voice, but I hate to say it... she is no Janis Joplin; can't say I like it

11. "Stars On 45" - Stars On 45

	- Novelty medley made by Dutch studio musicians; it's a mish-mash of various hit songs from the past
	- Every 4 bars or so, they change the song
	- Surprisingly, it's all Beatles songs with the exception of "Sugar, Sugar" by The Archies, and "Venus" by Shocking Blue
	- It's not half bad; each cover is done very faithfully to the original, but I can't imagine why something like this became a #1 hit

12. "The One That You Love" - Air Supply

	- Soft rock love song
	- Besides the fact that the vocal performace is pretty solid, it's really just a boring love song
	- "When in doubt, just do a key change towards the end!" Says every boring love song songwriter
	
13. "Jessie's Girl" - Rick Springfield

	- Rock song about being jealous of a friend's girlfriend
	- I really like that main guitar riff; plays well with the vocals
	- Nice guitar solo as well
	- Just a solid rock song; not much else to say
	
14. "Endless Love" - Diana Ross & Lionel Richie

	- Love song duet
	- I'm actually surprised; Richie managed to write a slow love ballad that sounds good here!
	- The chord progression and vocal performance are great; Ross sounds much better here when paired with Richie
	- I really like that last chorus; very powerful
	
15. "Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)" - Christopher Cross

	- Theme written for the film "Arthur"
	- Not a half-bad sax solo in the middle
	- It's nothing too special, but it does sound like a better version of "Killing Me Softly with His Song"

16. "Private Eyes" - Daryl Hall & John Oates

	- This one sounds very similar to "Kiss on My List", but I think this one sounds much better
	
17. "Physical" - Olivia Newton-John

	- #1 for 10 consectutive weeks, tieing "You Light Up My Life" by Debby Boone for the longest running #1 hit song
	- There's a sort of delay-effect on Newton-John's vocals, it's kind of neat
	- Great guitar solo in the middle
	- It's an alright song; not something I would write home about

OVERALL RANKING

1. "9 to 5" - Dolly Parton

Now we are back done into the "meh"; no real stand-outs this year. I will say that the average quality of the songs is getting better, so I guess I have nothing to complain about.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1982
----

1. "Physical" - Olivia Newton-John

	- #1 for 10 consectutive weeks, tieing "You Light Up My Life" by Debby Boone for the longest running #1 hit song
	- There's a sort of delay-effect on Newton-John's vocals, it's kind of neat
	- Great guitar solo in the middle
	- It's an alright song; not something I would write home about
	
2. "I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)" - Daryl Hall & John Oates

	- Okay, this is the BEST drum machine I've heard so heard
	- Outstanding synth lines throughout the whole song
	- There's a sort of call-response thing between Hall & Oates' vocals; I like it
	- I also like the real subtle guitar riff under synth lines
	- Oh, and there's also TWO banger sax solos too!

3. "Centerfold" - The J. Geils Band

	- Very upbeat pop-rock song
	- This song's weird; it's has the vibe of a kid-friendly song but it's about a Playboy centerfold
	- The main line during the chorus is nice and catchy
	- Overall, a pretty solid rock song
	
4. "I Love Rock N' Roll" - Joan Jett & The Blackhearts

	- Former guitarist for punk band The Runaways turned pop-rockstar
	- Cover of an old '70s rock song by The Arrows
	- Let's get this out of the way; this is THE rock anthem to end all rock anthems
	- That guitar riff is just too damn iconic
	- Plus that guitar solo; it's the icing on the cake
	
5. "Chariots Of Fire" - Vangelis

	- Synthpop instrumental made for the film of the same name
	- It's what is usually plasted over a video of a guy falling off of a diving board in slo-mo
	- The bass synth really helps to make the song sound very triumphant
	- I even like the main piano line; very pleasant
	
6. "Ebony and Ivory" - Paul McCartney & Stevie Wonder

	- Song written about racial unity during the time of Apartheid in South Africa
	- They both vocally sound good together, but it's nothing too special
	- The main synth line during the bridge sounds like an electric banjo; I don't like it
	- It's an alright song, a little too cheesy sounding for such a serious topic
	
7. "Don't You Want Me" - The Human League

	- This song is typically considered one of the best synthpop songs of the '80s
	- I'm gonna go against popular opinion; I don't like this song
	- There is just Waaaayyy too much going on in this song; too many synths at once is an attack on the ears
	- Besides the chorus, the vocal performance is lacking all-around
	
8. "Eye of the Tiger" - Survivor

	- Hard rock song written for the film Rocky 3
	- That's TWO #1 hit songs from the Rocky series of films!
	- Another absolute banger of a rock anthem
	- I mean, this song just reeks of ambition, motivation, and determination. Perfect for a montage!
	- Great guitar, vocals, and rhythm; just a great song
	
9. "Abracadabra" - Steve Miller Band

	- Hard rock sog about a witch
	- Great guitar riff; fits the mystic feel of the song
	- Also great synths on this one; also very fitting
	- The slide and whammy guitar solo is very unique and just straight-up badass
	- Outstanding outro; very spooky and ethereal sounding
	
10. "Hard to Say I'm Sorry" - Chicago

	- Soft rock ballad
	- In 1976, it was Steve Miller who knocked Chicago off of top of the charts, but Chicago strikes back!
	- Solid piano work on this one; good chord progession
	- Great vocals from Peter Cetera here, also great vocal harmonies
	- Solid ballad; unfortunately the single version excludes the second half of the movement "Get Away" which is almost a metal song and has a badass horn section

11. "Jack & Diane" - John Mellencamp

	- '80s heartland American teenage love anthem
	- I really how minimal the song is, just an acoustic guitar with a drum machine and the occasion bass and piano
	- I really like the chorus line; "Oh yeah life goes on, long after the thrill of livin' is gone..."

12. "Who Can It Be Now?" - Men At Work

	- Australian New wave song about a paranoid hermit
	- Outstanding sax all throughout the song
	- Great chorus; very singable
	- Just all-round great instrumentation; everything fits together so well here
	- Also, just an outstanding outro; those vocal harmonies are fantastic
	
13. "Up Where We Belong" - Joe Cocker & Jennifer Warnes

	- Soft piano ballad duet written for the romance film "An Officer and a Gentleman"
	- Has a nice chorus; sounds good
	- Besides that, this song is largely forgettable; total snoozer
	
14. "Truly" - Lionel Richie

	- Piano ballad; this guy just could not go a second without writing one of these, could he?
	- At this point, all of his songs just sound the same; I thought "Endless Love" was good, but I think that one has something going for it. This one's just "meh
	- I mean it's not a bad song, but at this point he just sounds like a one-trick pony
	
15. "Mickey" - Toni Basil

	- The one song that manages to sound '80s while also sounding like a bubblegum pop song
	- That opening line is just so tacky and hilarious
	- Somehow the '80s rock edge actually manages to make this bubblegum pop song sound good; I'm impressed
	- Chorus is kinda catchy; the vocal performance is a little cheesy though
	
16. "Maneater" - Daryl Hall & John Oates

	- A very minimal synthpop song
	- That bass line is so badass sounding
	- I really like the swingy rhythm; suits the song very well
	- Great vocal performace; that chorus is very catchy
	- Amazing sax solo in the middle, just fantastic

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1983
----

1. "Maneater" - Daryl Hall & John Oates

	- A very minimal synthpop song
	- That bass line is so badass sounding
	- I really like the swingy rhythm; suits the song very well
	- Great vocal performace; that chorus is very catchy
	- Amazing sax solo in the middle, just fantastic
	
2. "Down Under" - Men At Work

	- Another Australian new wave song; this times it's actually about Australia!
	- Great flute throughout the whole song
	- Very catchy chorus
	- The whole of the lyrics are silly but very endearing; I would say a good ambassador for Australia
	
3. "Africa" - Toto

	- Wow, two #1 hits songs about geography in a row! amazing!
	- Amazing use of percussion throughout; fits the theme of the song very well
	- Also, amazing synths as well!
	- Very powerful chorus, and those vocal harmonies... just outstanding
	- I know this song has become a meme of sorts, biut it really is just a great song; Toto's magnum opus

4. "Baby, Come to Me" - Patti Austin & James Ingram

	- A smooth R&B song
	- Very solid instrumentation; a perfect blend of tambres
	- Ingram is the better singer of the two; kinda makes me think it would have been better solo with him
	
5. "Billie Jean" - Michael Jackson

	- From the album "Thriller" the highest selling album of all-time
	- THIS was the one song that probably changed the pop music landscape the most this decade. The song, the album it was on, the music video, so much from just this one song
	- That drum beat with that bassline... just perfect
	- ...and then those synth stabs come in! It's so good!
	- Fantastic vocal performace from Jackson
	- That little guitar break that shows up around the mid-point is soooo funky

6. "Come On Eileen" - Dexys Midnight Runners

	- Unique sort of celtic/folk pop-song; strong use of strings and banjos
	- Very catchy verse and chorus; good vocal performance
	- Wow, a downward key change for the chorus! We haven't seen that since "Penny Lane"
	- I love how the song breaks down in the middle, and then speeds back up to the last chorus
	
7. "Beat It" - Michael Jackson

	- Pop song with a hard rock edge; Eddie Van Halen on guitar!
	- Another great intro with those synths and drum machine
	- Oh yeah, that guitar riff is just badass
	- I love the little breakdown after the second chorus; very metal!
	- One of the best guitar solos in a pop-song I've heard so far; up there with "My Sharona"
	
8. "Let's Dance" - David Bowie

	- Two #1 hits in a row that feature a guitar virtuoso! This time with Stevie Ray Vaughan
	- Bowie's vocals are outstanding on this one; such passion and power!
	- The build-up during the chorus is great; not many songs I've heard so far do that
	- SRV's inclusion is great; it's not over done anywhere; his little bits sprinkled throughout are the icing on the cake!
	
9. "Flashdance... What a Feeling" - Irene Cara

	- Synthpop song written for the film of the same name
	- I like the chord progression in this song; very well done especially during the chorus
	- I like the song, but it unfortunately, it's nothing too special when compared to everything else we've heard this year so far

10. "Every Breath You Take" - The Police

	- A Soft rock/new wave song about a stalker
	- So many people think this is a love song... it's not. It's about a LITERAL stalker
	- That guitar riff is so good; fits the theme of the song so well
	- That bridge is just legendary; "I keep cryin' baby... baby... pleeeeeeaaaaase!"
	- There are so many subtle bits of this song that just complement the song so well throughout
	- The backing vocals during the outro is fantastic. THAT is how you fade out a song!
	
11. "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" - Eurythmics

	- The most synthpoppy song you've ever heard; it sounds like we are in the lab of a mad scientist
	- Annie Lennox's vocals are just outstanding on this song
	- That bridge followed by that synth solo is just great; it's soooo good!
	
12. "Maniac" - Michael Sembello

	- Synthpop song also from the film "Flashdance"
	- Very fast and upbeat
	- The percussion makes it feel like we are in an industrial zone
	- I really like the bridge; very disorienting but in a good way... plus that guitar solo!
	- A solid song; very well done but suffers from being surrounded by better songs from this year
	
13. "Tell Her About It" - Billy Joel

	- A rockabilly song... kind of nice to hear this in a year full of synthpop
	- The lyrics are good, but a little too on-the-nose
	- Not a half-bad song; catchy and upbeat
	
14. "Total Eclipse of the Heart" - Bonnie Tyler

	- A slow ballad
	- Great use of vocals throughout; I especially like the call-response of the "turn around..." line
	- I really like how the song builds up to the chorus, but then chorus then continues to build up to that last line; great movement!
	- I do think the instrumentation in the middle is kind of lacking
	- You know, for a slow ballad, it ACUTALLY manages to wake you up instead of put you to sleep; somehow they did it here
	
15. "Islands In the Stream" - Kenny Rodgers & Dolly Parton

	- The two biggest pop-country stars of 1983 unite!
	- These two have great vocal chemistry; sounds great
	- Good chorus; nice and rhythmic sounding
	
16. "All Night Long (All Night)" - Lionel Richie

	- A sort of reggae/synth pop song
	- Interesting use of drum machines; it's like we are in the middle a jungle at night
	- I can hear Lionel trying his best to not go all-out with the patois impression; it's kinda funny
	- It's a very nice and upbeat song; not half-bad and pleasant to listen to
	
17. "Say Say Say" - Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson

	- An upbeat post-disco duet by two of the biggest pop stars in the world at the time
	- Funny enough, they really don't sing all that much together. They kind of just take turns with the verses
	- A real killer harmonica solo in the middle; a welcome surprise!
	- Just a solid pop song; not too much to complain about

An even better year! This one had so many great songs, it'll be hard to rank them in my final list across the decades. This is the first year where I can say that there wasn't a single "meh" or bad song. Impressive!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1984
----

1. "Say Say Say" - Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson

	- An upbeat post-disco duet by two of the biggest pop stars in the world at the time
	- Funny enough, they really don't sing all that much together. They kind of just take turns with the verses
	- A real killer harmonica solo in the middle; a welcome surprise!
	- Just a solid pop song; not too much to complain about
	
2. "Owner of a Lonely Heart" - Yes

	- Prog Rock song
	- WHAT!? Yes had a #1 hit song? One of my favorite bands from the '70s?
	- I really love that main riff; so meaty
	- The sampling throughout the song is just fantastic; very Prog indeed!
	- That bridge is so damn funky!
	- The guitar solo with the octave pedal is so damn badass
	- I'm sorry, I'm very biased here. I love this band. Yes does sacrifice a lot of their experimental prog sound to fit a more poppy sound, but I think they do it very well here

3. "Karma Chameleon" - Culture Club

	- I really the chorus-effect on the main guitar; sounds good
	- Not a half bad use of the blues harp throughout the song
	- Very catchy chorus; very singable
	- Great song; has a unique sound compared to the other pop hits
	
4. "Jump" - Van Halen

	- Hard rock band does a quasi-ballad about talking someone off the edge
	- Those synths are so good! sounds very acidic while also jovial at the same time
	- The pre-chorus is great, the way that the guitar and vocals build up to the chorus is fantastic
	- Eddie Van was such a great guitarist, as demonstrated by the solo
	- Let's also not ignore the fantastic synth solo! Amazing sound
	
5. "Footloose" - Kenny Loggins

	- Country artist turned '80s pop star writes the title track for the film of the same name
	- That rhythm section is so on-point it's not even funny
	- That flanger effect on the guitar is also on point; never would have thought it would so well with the song
	- The whole song is like a cross of synth pop and blues rock and it works so well!
	- It's also damn catchy as well
	
6. "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)" - Phil Collins

	- Prog rock drummer turned '80s pop star writes the title track for film of the same name (wait, didn't I just write that?)
	- It's a piano ballad by the way
	- This is another soft-spot song for me. It's really not that different than most of the other slow piano ballads we've heard so far, but there's just something about this song that sends it into the stratosphere; I can't put my finger on it

7. "Hello" - Lionel Richie

	- Another slow ballad by Richie
	- Nice piano movement throughout the song
	- I really like the slow guitar solo in the middle; very pleasant
	- I think it's a bit better than his other ballads, but not by much; the instrumentation is what saves it

8. "Let's Hear It for the Boy" - Deniece Williams

	- Another song from the film Footloose; very upbeat
	- I really like the synths on this one, has a cheery yet punchy quality to it
	- Her voice is much better since we last heard her
	- A love song that actually celebrates someone with common flaws? That makes this song at least a step above most love songs

9. "Time After Time" - Cyndi Lauper

	- A soft rock/new wave song
	- Those synths plus that guitar with the chorus-effect is very good
	- I really like that chorus, the vocals are really good and the guitar is very nice and sublety behind the mix
	- This is a league above her other songs. I'm sorry, but "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" is just not that good compared to this

10. "The Reflex" - Duran Duran

	- Synthpop/new wave song
	- I think this a rare example of a song that has so much going on in it that I actualy enjoy
	- I just really wish the bass was further up in the mix; it's soooo good on this song
	- I will admit that the "WhHhHhHyYyYyY" warble thing going on with the vocals is annoying
	- The little breakdown thing in the middle I do like despite having the vocal-thing in it
	- I think it's funny that Duran Duran is best remembered by their songs that didn't reach #1. It's like their #1 hits were flash-in-the-pan successes that everyone forgot about

11. "When Doves Cry" - Prince

	- Holy shit, that guitar intro is absolutely amazing. He rips that solo apart in the first few seconds!
	- The intro is just great. The "yeah.... yeah... yeah..." vocal fade into the main synth line is top-notch
	- Surprisingly minimal; There's just the vocals, the drum machine, and the occational synth. No bass to be found
	- Prince did everything on this song by the way; all the instruments and vocals
	- Amazing outro, those baroque-style synth chords with that powerful vocal send-off is just perfect

12. "Ghostbusters" - Ray Parker Jr.

	- One-hit wonder; theme from the film of the same name
	- I really don't know what to say about this song that hasn't already been said. It's like the perfect theme song for a movie about a ghost-removal service

13. "What's Love Got to Do with It" - Tina Turner

	- Oldest person to have a #1 up until this point; Turner aged 44 at the time
	- The lead up to and the chorus itself are pretty good; very caribbean sounding
	- I will say that the synth harmonica is a little tacky; a product of the decade it came from
	- It's an alright song; not bad, but not amazing

14. "Missing You" - John Waite

	- Power ballad
	- It's not half-bad; but it's really nothing to write home about
	
15. "Let's Go Crazy" - Prince & The Revolution

	- Song about living life to the fullest; we all gonna die anyway, so let's have some fun!
	- That preacher-intro with those Church chords are such a great idea
	- That drum machine beat is just fantastic
	- I really love that "Oh no, let's go!" refrain, too catchy!
	- Great guitar solo in the middle; fits the song very well
	- Oh yeah, and the outro is also amazing; face-melting guitar solo, bluey breakdown, and that "Take me away!" line at the end is absolutely amazing

16. "I Just Called To Say I Love You" - Stevie Wonder

	- Love ballad
	- The song is very well-composed; Wonder was always great in that regard
	- I will say that I do think the lyrics are kinda cheesy. I guess they are innocent and docile, but there's just something about it that makes it feel dated. If only I was a better critic!
	- No Stevie! Don't! Don't fall for the "key-change-upwards-when-your-out-of-ideas" trap!
	- Oh God! He did it twice! The horror!
	
17. "Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)" - Billy Ocean

	- Very gritty-sounding for a synthpop R&B song
	- I really like the vocals on the chorus; the way they stack is just great
	- Can't go without having a killer sax solo!
	- Overall, a pretty good song; solid work on this one
	
18. "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" - Wham!

	- First #1 for George Michael
	- The throwback bubblegum pop feel actually works pretty good; I thought it'd sound bad but it's actually well done
	- Insanely catchy
	- Did he just say "beats-per-minute" as a lyric? Haha!
	- Michael has a pretty good voice throughout; solid work
	- There's even a not-half-bad horn solo in the middle
	
19. "Out of Touch" - Daryl Hall & John Oates

	- I love the gritty drum-machine, bass-line, and synth; they work together soooo well here
	- Even this late in the game, Hall & Oates still were writing bangers!
	- Amazing chorus; very singable
	- Also great bridge; the way it just hangs for a bit... fantastic
	
20. "Like a Virgin" - Madonna

	- The first of a truck-load of #1 hits Madonna would have throughout her whole career
	- ...and it's alright. I kind of like the main synth-line and the chord progression is good, but it's nothing too special
	- I can't say I've ever liked Madonna's voice, but she sounds good enough. It's not like she's warbbling all over the place or anything, so I got to give her credit for that XD

OVERALL RANKING

1. "When Doves Cry" - Prince
2. "Let's Go Crazy" - Prince & The Revolution
3. "Out of Touch" - Daryl Hall & John Oates
4. "Owner of a Lonely Heart" - Yes

19. "I Just Called To Say I Love You" - Stevie Wonder
20. "Hello" - Lionel Richie

Not a bad year. If anything, I guess the novelty of the '80s sound is starting to wear thin, but it's so good on it's own that it kind of grows on you. I know that there will be some really good songs to come in the next few years as some folks hone the sound even more or even journey into some of the proto-90s stuff. I look forward to it!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1985
----

1. "Like a Virgin" - Madonna

	- The first of a truck-load of #1 hits Madonna would have throughout her whole career
	- ...and it's alright. I kind of like the main synth-line and the chord progression is good, but it's nothing too special
	- I can't say I've ever liked Madonna's voice, but she sounds good enough. It's not like she's warbbling all over the place or anything, so I got to give her credit for that XD

2. "I Want to Know What Love Is" - Foreigner

	- Slow synth ballad
	- I love the sound of that synth; so haunting
	- Very powerful pre-chorus and chorus; especially when the choir comes in at the end of the song
	- A solid power ballad; I guess having '70s rock chops automatically makes you good at writing songs outside of your wheelhouse


3. "Careless Whisper" - Wham! feat. George Michael

	- I have no clue as to why Michael is considered a featured artist to his own group. That'd be like "Queen feat. Freddie Mercury"
	- Anyway, probably one of the most recognizable songs from the '80s plus one of the most recognizable sax riffs ever
	- I do like the groove of the song; it doesn't go overboard at any time; it's on point!
	- I feel like this is what Lionel Richie was trying to go for with "Hello", but failed to do so
	- Overall a good song; can't figure out why this has such a legacy. It's good, but I don't think it's anything too special

4. "Can't Fight This Feeling" - REO Speedwagon

	- Another power ballad from REO
	- This has much more piano in it. I actually think it has a good progession; they are definitely talented
	- A good ballad; If the world had to pick only one act to be the sole-ballad songwriter, I think these guys would be on the table for sure

5. "One More Night" - Phil Collins

	- Synthpop ballad
	- Surprisingly minimal; just vocals synths, and a single drum machine on loop
	- I really like Phil Collins, one of my favorite pop stars, but I can't say I like this one all that much. It's like he's trying to be reallll smooth-sounding, but it comes off so tacky

6. "We Are The World" - U.S.A. For Africa

	- A whole bunch of pop stars came together to record a song to raise money for African humanitarian aid; written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson
	- By the way, this was one of two charity songs that inspired the formation of Live Aid a few months later
	- This actually has quite a diverse cast; Stevie Wonder, Kenny Rogers, Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan... friggin' Dan Aykroyd! What the Hell!?
	- Every soloist's contribution is actually pretty good; they all bring their own flavor to the song. My favorite is toss-up between Kenny Loggins and Ray Charles
	- It's actually a decent song; I guess when you bring together a whole bunch of artists, you're bound to have everyone's contribution lead to something decent

7. "Crazy for You" - Madonna

	- Synthpop song written for the film "Vision Quest"
	- I really like the progession of the song; surprisingly upbeat
	- Madonna's vocal performace is good; not completely overdone
	- Not a half-bad song, but nothing to write home about
	
8. "Don't You (Forget About Me)" - Simple Minds

	- Synthpop/new wave song
	- The subtle synths and guitars under the verses is so good; really complements the song very well
	- The vocal performance on this song if phenomenal; so restrained and vunerable and then on that last chorus, Jim Kerr hits you with that power... legendary!
	- That drum beat is also great; so driving and on point!
	- If you've seen the episode of Futurama called "The Luck of the Fryish", then this song might elicit some emotions in some people

9. "Everything She Wants" - Wham!

	- That drum machine is so catchy; and then those synths come in... just great!
	- Those hums, ho's and la's during the pre-chorus sound so good
	- Probably the closest a standard '80s pop song can be to great while maintaining the sound that will eventually date it
	
10. "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" - Tears for Fears

	- Synthpop song
	- Amazing vocals on this song, so much power and precision
	- That staggered drum beat is just phenomenal
	- That bridge when the guitar comes in, amazing!
	- The little synth break before the first guitar solo really sends this song into the stratosphere
	- The construction of this song is so on-point that it isn't even funny; so many layers of this song stack to create something great
	
11. "Heaven" - Bryan Adams

	- Power ballad from everyone's favorite Canadian rock star
	- I really like that chorus; sounds good!
	- Great guitar solo in the middle; fits the song well
	- I'm impressed at how quickly ballads improved in quality. Every ballad so far this year is managing to not put me to sleep xD
	
12. "Sussudio" - Phil Collins

	- An onslaught of '80s sounds; drum machines, synths, and samples hit your senses in a dance-fueled craze!
	- Phil's voice is so on-point here, plus that reverb effect on his voice really makes this song great
	- Honestly, this song rocks. It takes all of the best elements of the '80s sound and cranks it up to 11
	
13. "A View to a Kill" - Duran Duran

	- Written for the opening credits sequence for the James Bond film of the same name
	- Funny story how this song came about: The band was at a party with the producer of the film, and then the bassist John Taylor drunkenly asked if they could do the theme song for the film and then that same night, they were writing it but they all passed out and almost forgot about it the next morning!
	- It's actually a great song; Duran Duran do a good job of fusing the Bond theme style with their own.
	- The chorus is so good; it just screams "Bond!"
	
14. "Every Time You Go Away" - Paul Young

	- Synth ballad written Daryl Hall of "Hall & Oates"
	- An '80s pop song with a sitar in it? It's like George Harrison walked in to record this!
	- Good vocals from Young; nothing legendary, but still pretty solid
	- Solid instrumentation throughout; it can't shake that '80s production tackiness, but it runs with it so well that it mitigates it
	
15. "Shout" - Tears For Fears

	- Synthpop song about political protest
	- Those industrial drums, It's almost like I'm listening to a Depeche Mode song from the '90s; way ahead of it's time!
	- This song is so damn gritty and edgy, I'm surprised that became a #1 hit in a mostly edgeless '80s landscape
	- That little synth solo in the middle; just amazing!
	- That guitar solo at the end... one of the few solos that give me goosebumps. Perfection.

16. "The Power Of Love" - Huey Lewis & The News

	- Wow, we went from proto-'90s grittyness to edgeless '80s pop rock in a single week!
	- Written for the movie "Back to the Future"
	- Very catchy and bluesy; really blends '80s synthpop with blue rock very well
	- I really love that bridge; the vocals with those guitar chords. It's sooo good!
	- Also an absolute banger of a guitar solo
	
17. "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion) - John Parr

	- '80s rock ballad written for the film of the same name
	- I think this is the first ballad dud... it's just so overdone. Every instrument is cranked up to 11, and not balanced or mixed at all
	- Eh, it's just "meh". Not something to get excited about when it comes on the radio

18. "Money For Nothing" - Dire Straits

	- Blue rock group from England write a song poking fun of the vapidness of the MTV generation
	- That synth swell and drums leading into that iconic guitar riff... absolutely legendary
	- THIS is how to do a blue rock song; top-notch
	- I don't know what else to say; it's just a fantastic song!
	
19. "Oh Sheila" - Ready For The World

	- This is NOT a Prince song. I know it sounds like one, but it isn't. However, does it stack up to him?
	- Kind of. It definitely embodies all of the characteristics of the Minneapolis-sound that Prince popularized, but I can't say it's Prince-tier
	- It is very catchy though; I guess making a Minneapolis-sound song by default bumps it up a few notches

20. "Take On Me" - a-ha

	- Another iconic synthpop/new wave song; probably more well-known by it's music video that looks like a comic-book sketch came to life
	- That drum machine is sooo driving; I think I know why they made the music video race-car themed
	- Also, that synthline is just perfect; suits the song too well
	- Great vocal range on the singer; definitely the kind of thing that every drunk patreon of a bar during karaoke night tries to sing but fails miserably at
	- That chromatic synth run during the bridge is just fantastic
	
21. "Saving All My Love for You" - Whitney Houston

	- Slow R&B ballad written back in 1978
	- It definitely sounds like it was written in the '70s, but grafted onto an '80s artists... that's not a bad thing though!
	- Houston's voice is really good on this one; it's a shame how she died 

22. "Part-Time Lover" - Stevie Wonder

	- Stevie Wonder's last #1 hit of his career
	- Okay this one is literally hard to listen to; The drums are way to loud and the drum machine is going way too fast
	- Man, Stevie Wonder really phone it in this decade; a darn shame since he was so good last decade

23. "Miami Vice Theme" - Jan Hammer

	- Instrumental theme for the TV show of the same name
	- "Hey Hammer, can you write me us a theme song for this TV show we got? Oh, and can you make it so '80s sounding that that's all people will remember it for?"
	- Really not all that good; a far-cry from the quality of "Theme from Shaft"
	
24. "We Built This City" - Starship

	- Oh, how the mighty have fallen... from Jefferson Airplane, to Jefferson Starship, to just Starship; not a single founding member is present here
	- Could this be concidered a Jefferson Airplane song? This band would be a great case-study for the "Ship of Theseus" thought-experiment
	- I will say that it's a superb and well-done synthpop song, but what ruins it is the lyrics about rejecting "corporation games" while sounding like the most corporate-sounding pop music ever written

25. "Seperate Lives" - Phil Collins & Marilyn Martin

	- Love ballad duet written for the film "White Nights"
	- Honestly, it's real boring; I can see why you never hear it on the radio or talked about when people reminisce about music from the '80s
	
26. "Broken Wings" - Mr. Mister

	- Synth rock song
	- I can't say I dislike the synths on this one; the way that they linger over the song is nice and forboding
	- The wash of sounds towards the end is kind of nice, but I do think it's a little overboard

27. "Say You, Say Me" - Lionel Richie

	- Love ballad written also written for the flim "White Nights"
	- Okay, this song has one of the most needless bridges I've ever heard; it does not fit the song AT ALL
	- Bah, another slow boring song; this one just drags on for 4 minutes; feels like an eternity

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Shout" - Tears For Fears
2. "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" - Tears for Fears
3. "Money For Nothing" - Dire Straits
4. "Don't You (Forget About Me)" - Simple Minds

24. "Miami Vice Theme" - Jan Hammer
25. "Say You, Say Me" - Lionel Richie
26. "Part-Time Lover" - Stevie Wonder

A decent year; THIS was the year of the synthpop/new wave hit song, and I do not mind that at all. Some of my favorites I've heard so far are in this year alone. Overall, I enjoyed this year.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1986
----

1. "Say You, Say Me" - Lionel Richie

	- Love ballad written also written for the flim "White Nights"
	- Okay, this song has one of the most needless bridges I've ever heard; it does not fit the song AT ALL
	- Bah, another slow boring song; this one just drags on for 4 minutes; feels like an eternity
	
2. "That's What Friends Are For" - Dionne & Friends

	- Cover of a Rod Stewart song to help raise money for AIDS research
	- Meh, slow boring song; I do think that Stevie Wonder's vocal parts are good though
	
3. "How Will I Know" - Whitney Houston

	- Very upbeat; I like how the drum machine and synths play off each other
	- Houston's voice is really good here; especially during the chorus
	- Okay, this song does the "key-change-upwards" cliche, but it actually sounds good; it's complimented by a little sax riff, which makes it feel a lot more natural

4. "Kyrie" - Mr. Mister

	- Synth rock song
	- This song's synths really are the driving force here; very well done
	- I do think the cheery chorus is little out of place from the more industrial-sounding verse sections
	- "Key change upwards" but it's not actually that bad; not amazing, but not terrible
	
5. "Sara" - Starship

	- Synth rock ballad
	- Those synths are so spooky
	- This song actually manages to sound very forboding; kind of unique for a love song
	- Mickey Thomas' voice is good here too; solid work here
	- A decent guitar solo in the middle; fits the song well
	
6. "These Dreams" - Heart

	- '70s hard rock band turned massive '80s pop act
	- It's well done for the most part, but it's a mostly forgettable song
	
7. "Rock Me Amadeus" - Falco

	- Synthpop song about Mozart; first German language #1 hit
	- Falco was like the Michael Jackson of Europe; he was HUGE over there
	- This song is so damn silly, but Falco owns the aesthetic so well that it makes it kind of a bad-ass song
	- Very catchy chorus; very singable, and you don't even need to know German to sing it!
	
8. "Kiss" - Prince & The Revolution

	- Very minimal funk rock song; just a drum machine, vocals, and some guitar here and there
	- That main guitar riff that opens the song is great
	- Prince is singing in this really high-falsetto; I'm kinda mixed on it. Sometime it sounds good, other times it sounds whiny
	- When that little guitar break comes in after the second chorus sends this song into funk heaven

9. "Addicted to Love" - Robert Palmer

	- That snare drum sounds so good; just a solid rhythm-section
	- Oh yeah, that guitar riff is the epitome of badassery
	- Palmer's vocal performance is great on this song; he's got an amazing range, and he knows how to use it to serve the song
	- Very catchy chorus!
	
10. "West End Girls" - Pet Shop Boys

	- Synthpop song
	- Those synth chords are just ethereal; very well-done and fit the mood of ther song so well
	- The little bass synths that are played throughout the whole song are also on point
	- The vocals are funny as hell; this posh British guy is literally rapping over a synthpop song
	- Man, these guys really know their craft. They went all out on the synths on this track, and it doesn't sound like an assualt on the ears. It actually sounds great!

11. "Greatest Love of All" - Whitney Houston

	- Cover of a song done by George Benson back in 1977
	- It's a slow boring ballad for the most part; but Houston's vocal performace is so phenomenal that it actually manages to make it good

12. "Live to Tell" - Madonna

	- Ballad written for the film "Fire with Fire"; originally an instrumental, Madonna wrote lyrics for it and it turned into a pop single
	- Wow, this is a pop song? It's so spooky sounding, like it should be part of the soundtrack of "Halloween"
	- I mean, it's okay. Not much happens, and it kind of drags on for 6 minutes
	
13. "On My Own" - Patti LaBelle & Michael McDonald
	
	- Mid-tempo love duet
	- McDonald is the much better singer here; they do sound good together for the most part, but he really steals the show on this song
	- Not half-bad; kinda wish it had more to it though
	
14. "There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)" - Billy Ocean

	- Slow ballad
	- Honestly, Ocean sounds a lot better when doing his more upbeat stuff; Here, he just sounds "ok"
	- It's really just a "meh" song; really nothing that great

15. "Holding Back the Years" - Simply Red

	- Another slow ballad... when will it end?!
	- Actually, this sounds REALLY good; The insturmentation is very jazzy, and singer Mick Hucknall's voice is very good
	- To add to the vocals, It's very restrained, and he only belts out when appropriate
	- Also that chorus is just great
	- The build up to that final high-note on the last lyric is just perfection

16. "Invisible Touch" - Genesis

	- Wow, one of my favorite bands! They went from really avant-garde, conceptual prog rock to the most standard synthpop rock in just a matter of a decade
	- It's a nice and upbeat song, Phil Collins vocals are solid here
	- Their prog roots are still here, that breakdown in the middle sounds like some kind of proto Nine Inch Nails; I like it
	- Oh no! Genesis! Don't do it! Nooooooo! They did the "key-change-upwards" thing! Ah!!!!!!

17. "Sledgehammer" - Peter Gabriel

	- This is some divine intervention shit; Peter Gabriel was the former singer for Genesis, and he gets his own #1 hit a week after his former band got theirs. Ha!
	- Besides that, can we just appreciate how badass this song is? It's so damn funky! Especially during that chorus
	- If you haven't seen the music video for this song yet, you need to look it up. It's wild!
	- When those pan-flutes come in during the outro... and then the groove gets even more funky... it's just sooo good!

18. "Glory of Love" - Peter Cetera

	- Ballad written for the film "Karate Kid Part II"
	- Did Cetera mix up which movie he was writing a song for? This just feels so out of place for this kind of movie
	- Honestly, it's just boring; Not to take away from Cetera's talent, but this just feels like he phoned this one in

19. "Papa Don't Preach" - Madonna

	- Song about teen pregnancy
	- I got to give Madonna credit for writting a song about this topic; She got boycotted by the Pope! Even just singing about the topic of teen pregnancy is too much for the prudes at the Vatican! Haha!
	- As for the song itself, it's okay; it's not bad, but it's nothing too special

20. "Higher Love" - Steve Winwood

	- The heavy use of percussion in this song is just fantastic
	- Outstanding use of synths and bass; used at just the right times!
	- Also, fantastic vocals from Winwood; especially during the chorus. It really elevates the song to a "Higher" level
	- The breakdown towards the end of the song is great
	
21. "Venus" - Bananarama

	- Synthpop cover of the #1 hit song from 1970; originally by "Shocking Blue"
	- Wow, I'm amazed. It actually manages to sound even better with the '80s sound! It adds a sort of urgency to the song it didn't have before
	- I really like those guitar chords sprinkled throughout the song
	- Overall a solid cover; they knew what they were doing
	
22. "Take My Breath Away" - Berlin

	- Synthpop ballad written by Giorgio Moroder for the film "Top Gun"
	- I think the vocals are good, but the synths are so over-the-top that it really dates the song
	
23. "Stuck With You" - Huey Lewis & The News
	
	- Pop rock song done in the style of an early '60s rock band
	- It's very faithful to that early rock sound; Very talented in that regard
	- It's a good song, but there's nothing too special about it
	
24. "When I Think Of You" - Janet Jackson

	- The youngest of the Jackson siblings, she now gets her first #1 hit
	- Solid bassline and piano chord progression
	- Not a half-bad song; solid performace from Jackson here
	
25. "True Colors" - Cyndi Lauper

	- A very simple, minimal ballad
	- I really like those disonant guitar arpeggios; neat to see those in a pop song
	- Lauper's vocal performace is very good here, I just really wish her voice wasn't so nasally

26. "Amanda" - Boston

	- Another '70s hard rock band turned '80s pop rock band
	- Originally recorded in 1981, but took 5 years to be released
	- This song hurts to listen to. That's not saying the song's bad, but there's something about the way it's mixed that it's making my head vibrate
	- It's a pretty solid power ballad; Boston was always a very talented band and each member of the band were masters of their craft

27. "Human" - The Human League

	- Synthpop ballad
	- Nothing screams "We're not robots at all, we promise!" like a song called "Human" by a band called "The Human League"
	- Now that is one hell of a drum beat; so snappy and raw!
	- This song probably has some of the best synths I've ever heard; so profound and well-mixed. It's like it's piercing your soul
	- Amazing vocal performaces; especially during that second verse
	- The way the synths fade the song out is just phenomenal; gives me goosebumps
	
28. "You Give Love A Bad Name" - Bon Jovi

	- Our first Glam Metal #1 hit so far
	- I really like that main guitar riff during the verses; especially when they hit those pitch harmonics!
	- Very singable chorus; I can imagine a whole stadium of people made out of 96% hairspray products belting this out in unison
	- Not a half-bad guitar solo too!
	
29. "The Next Time I Fall" - Peter Cetera & Amy Grant

	- Love ballad duet
	- Largely forgettable; nothing special at all about the performances
	
30. "The Way It Is" - Bruce Hornsby & The Range

	- A very upbeat piano ballad about the 1964 Poverty Act and Civil Rights Act of 1964
	- I really love that drum beat; it's so driving and that snare sounds awesome
	- That piano chord movement during the chorus is so damn good; I get chills hearing it
	- That piano solo in the middle is absolutely angelic; probably the best one I've heard so far
	- It is impossible to put into words how amazing this song is
	
31. "Walk Like an Egyptian" - The Bangles

	- Upbeat pop-rock song with an Egyptian theme
	- The use of Eastern instrumentation and modes/scales is top-notch; it's probably not super accurate to Egyptian specifically, but it's well done
	- The "Way Ohh Way Ohh Oh Way Ohh Wayyyy Ohhhhh" during the chorus is so singable
	- Awesome guitar solo in the middle as well!

29. "Say You, Say Me" - Lionel Richie
30. "Glory of Love" - Peter Cetera
31. "The Next Time I Fall" - Peter Cetera & Amy Grant

If last year was the year of the New Wave hit, this was the year of the slow '80s ballad. Can't say I enjoy this year all that much. Once again, some of my favorites are in this year but the whole year itself was weighted-down by a bunch of dated fluff. I think I am now ready for the '90s. Didn't think I'd burn out 6 years into the decade, but that's just the way it is (Hey! A reference to a song from this year!).

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1987
----

1. "Walk Like an Egyptian" - The Bangles

	- Upbeat pop-rock song with an Egyptian theme
	- The use of Eastern instrumentation and modes/scales is top-notch; it's probably not super accurate to Egyptian specifically, but it's well done
	- The "Way Ohh Way Ohh Oh Way Ohh Wayyyy Ohhhhh" during the chorus is so singable
	- Awesome guitar solo in the middle as well!
	
2. "Shake You Down" - Gregory Abbott

	- No, that is NOT the current governor of Texas singing
	- Honestly, this is just a boring R&B song, it's really not that good
	
3. "At This Moment" - Billy Vera & The Beaters

	- Live performace originally recorded in 1981; became a #1 hit after it was featured on the TV show "Family Ties"
	- It's not a half-bad song; it's sort of a slow, bluesy, piano ballad
	- I can't hate the sax solo in the middle, it's a nice addition
	
4. "Open Your Heart" - Madonna

	- Upbeat dance-pop song
	- Nothing really to complain about, it's a decent song. If anything, Madonna had some really good composers working with her

5. "Livin' On a Prayer" - Bon Jovi

	- Glam rock song about a rocky relationship between two working class people
	- VH1 put this song at #1 of their "greatest songs of the '80s" list some years ago. Does it stack up?
	- I mean, it is indeed a good song, but I don't really concider it THAT legendary
	- That bassline stacked with the talkbox guitar riff is just great
	- I really how the minor-key verses lead into the major-key chorus; really good composition
	- Honestly, the lyrics are pretty good; it's relatable and not really preachy
	- It does suffer from the "key-change-upwards" cliche, unfortunately
	
6. "Jacob's Ladder" - Huey Lewis & The News

	- Pop-rock song critiqing evangelical preachers, and about living one day at a time; written by Bruce Hornsby
	- I really like this song; especially that chorus "step-by-step, rung-by-rung, climbing Jacob's ladder"
	- Solid guitar work throughout; fits the song well
	
7. "Lean on Me" - Club Nouveau

	- New-jack swing cover of the #1 hit originally done by Bill Withers
	- I think this was the first '90s hit song; it's pretty much sounds at least 3 years ahead of it's time
	- This might be sacrilege, but I actually like this version better then the orignal. It takes the soft, somber, interpersonal orignal and turns it into an upbeat anthem of friendship and helping others
	- I think the little breakdown in the middle with the reggae "we be jamin'!" refrain is great

8. "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" - Starship

	- Power ballad featured in the flim "Mannequin"
	- It's not terrible, but it's really nothing too special; standard affair for a power ballad
	- I will give it credit for doing the "key-change-upwards" gracefully; it sounds natural and fits the song
	
9. "I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)" - Aretha Franklin & George Michael

	- It only took 20 years, but Franklin's back on top! this time with George Michael
	- Franklin and Michael have good vocal chemistry; probably the best duet we've heard so far this decade
	- Pretty solid song; good to see when a plan comes together!
	
10. "(I Just) Died In Your Arms" - Cutting Crew

	- New wave/pop rock song about... well... a phenomenon called "la petite mort". I'll let you look that one up
	- The chorus is fantastic; It does a good job of serving the song
	- I really like that guitar solo in the middle; so somber yet fits the upbeat nature of the song

11. "With or Without You" - U2

	- Irish new wave/pop rock band scores their first #1 hit
	- I really love how simple this song is; it using the "4 chords" of pop, but with that bassline, quiet synths, and vunerable lyrics, it's probably one of the best "simple" songs I've heard so far
	- When that delayed guitar riff comes in; it just sends this song into the clouds. The Edge is a great guitarist
	- This all builds up to that crescendo after the second chorus, which is just amazing song composition
	
12. "You Keep Me Hangin' On" - Kim Wilde

	- Synthpop cover of the #1 hit song from 1966, originally performed by The Supremes
	- Unlike "Venus" by Bananarama, I feel like the synthpop aesthetic doesn't really fit the song all that well
	- That's not to take away from the talent of Kim Wilde, but this is far from her best work
	
13. "Always" - Atlantic Starr

	- Slow R&B ballad
	- the vocal performaces are good, but the song itself really isn't anything special; standard duet ballad
	
14. "Head to Toe" - Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam

	- Another '90s-sounding hit song from 1987
	- Has a Motown funk feel to it; kinda neat
	- Wow, I was not expecting a guitar solo in the middle; it's pretty good too!
	- It's a decent song; it does kind of drag on for 5 minutes though
	
15. "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)" - Whitney Houston

	- This song really abuses the hell out of that Roland drum machine... and that's not a bad thing!
	- Amazing vocal performace from Houston; probably her best so far
	
16. "Alone" - Heart

	- Soft rock ballad
	- I just can't figure out why people were so obsessed with Heart at this stage in their career; THIS has NOTHING on songs like "Barracuda" or "Crazy On You"
	- Just another boring ballad; I will say it's better than their last one, but not by much

17. "Shakedown" - Bob Seger

	- Very upbeat synth rock song written for the film Beverly Hills Cop II
	- Insanely driving; definitely a driving song for sure
	- That chorus is so catchy; very well-written
	- Not a half-bad guitar solo either!
	
18. "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" - U2

	- Very similar to their last #1 hit, but this time it's much more cheery
	- Very good vocal performace by Bono
	- This is the kind of song to listen to when your in a bad mood; to lift your spirits up!
	
19. "Who's That Girl" - Madonna

	- Insanely similar to her previous single "La Isla Bonita"
	- Wow, this one's pretty lame; the phoned-in latin influence, the half-assed spanish lyrics, the repetitive nature of the song; it's a real shame because Madonna and company are much better than this

20. "La Bamba" - Los Lobos

	- Chicano rock cover of the 1958 hit song by Richie Valens (One of three musicians that died on "The Day The Music Died". Recorded for the biopic of the same name
	- Very faithful to the original; I'm sure Richie Valens would be proud
	- Unlike the last #1 song, this one is sung in spanish by people who actaully know spanish!
	- That guitar solo in the middle is so good!
	
21. "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" - Michael Jackson with Siedah Garrett

	- First #1 hit from Michael Jackson's album "Bad"; love duet
	- Honestly, this is such a weak performance; Jackson is so much better than this, but I guess he had to pad-out the album with something

22. "Didn't We Almost Have It All" - Whitney Houston

	- Slow R&B ballad
	- You know, if it wasn't for Houston's amazing vocal performace, this would just be another lame ballad. It's crazy to think how one person's voice can carry a whole damn song

23. "Here I Go Again" - Whitesnake

	- Glam metal power ballad; originally recorded as a blues rock song in 1982, re-recorded to fit the glam metal scene
	- I do like the chorus; it's pretty good
	- If you bother to listen to album this song is on, listen to "Still of the Night". It's the much better single compared to this one. This one's just kind of "ok"

24. "Lost In Emotion" - Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam

	- Oh shit, that bassline intro is tasty as hell
	- Okay, that "hit the beat now..." line is friggin' hilarious; it's so soft and lacks the punch a line like that one should have
	- Besides that bassline, this song is just really boring. This should have been recorded as an upbeat club song, not this dawdling mid-tempo ballad

25. "Bad" - Michael Jackson

	- "Billie Jean" may have been Jackson's magnum opus, but I always thought this was his most fun song
	- That bassline line, those synth leads, that drum machine; it's just perfect
	- Also another amazing chorus; very singable
	- Jackson was probably one of leading figures to popularize "bad" as a positive adjective from this time period

26. "I Think We're Alone Now" - Tiffany

	- Teeny bopper cover of an old "Tommy James & The Shondells" song; recorded when Tiffany was just 15-years-old
	- It's got a nice upbeat feel; that bassline is kind of good
	- Overall, it's okay; nothing too special

27. "Mony Mony" - Billy Idol

	- Wow, 2 "Tommy James & The Shondells" covers in a row! This one's the live version, not the one recorded in 1981 that everyone knows
	- I like this live performace; it's got a punk rock feel to it, which makes sense considering Idol's punk roots
	- Despite that, I still think the 1981 version that Idol did was better

28. "(I've Had) The Time of My Life" - Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes

	- Love theme written for the film "Dirty Dancing"
	- I like the use of strings on this one; it's nice to hear those after the onslaught of synths so far this decade
	- Not a half-bad sax solo either!
	- It's a well composed song, but I honestly think it's just "ok"; I really don't know why this song has the legacy it does

29. "Heaven Is a Place on Earth" - Belinda Carlisle

	- Mid-tempo power ballad
	- I like the reverb on the vocals, really fits the "angelic" theme of the song
	- I like the chorus; either than that, it's nothing too special
	
30. "Faith" - George Michael

	- Crossover of '50s rock and '80s pop
	- I really like the church organ intro and how it dry cuts into that Bo Diddley rhythm
	- Great vocal performace from Michael; just solid work throughout
	- Perfectly timed electric and steel guitar solo; well-composed
	- Do yourself a favor and DO NOT listen to the cover of this song by Limp Bizkit

We've finally arrived at the '90s! Well, sort of. It's clear that the chart toppers of this year are starting to have that '90s sound, and I'm ready to move on. However, we still got 2 more years of this decade, so let's finish strong!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1988
----

1. "Faith" - George Michael

	- Crossover of '50s rock and '80s pop
	- I really like the church organ intro and how it dry cuts into that Bo Diddley rhythm
	- Great vocal performace from Michael; just solid work throughout
	- Perfectly timed electric and steel guitar solo; well-composed
	- Do yourself a favor and DO NOT listen to the cover of this song by Limp Bizkit
	
2. "So Emotional" - Whitney Houston

	- This one's got a bit of a more rock edge
	- It's got a neat guitar solo as well!
	- Nothing too special; it's a decent song
	
3. "Got My Mind Set on You' - George Harrison
	
	- The last #1 for a former Beatle; originally done by James Ray in 1962
	- Has got a very driving drum machine
	- This song's lyrics are just so lazy; I feel like the original songwriter could have squeezed in some other words besides "money" and "time"
	- It just feels so weird hearing George Harrison, the most spiritual and philisophical songwriter of the Beatles, doing a silly love song

4. "The Way You Make Me Feel" - Michael Jackson

	- I really love that triplet drum machine rhythm; so nice hearing that after so much "4-on-the-floor" this decade
	- Solid song composition; every key change and start-stop is so well done
	- Jackson giving a great vocal performace as always
	
5. "Need You Tonight" - INXS

	- Funk/New wave song
	- Oh wow, this one's insanely funky! I'm impressed to hear this from a band from Australia
	- That little slinky guitar breakdown in the middle is soooo good
	
6. "Could've Been" - Tiffany

	- Slow piano ballad
	- bah, another slow, boring, ballad; nothing special at all.
	
7. "Seasons Change" - Exposé

	- I really don't get this one; it's so dawdling and boring, I have no clue as to how a song like this was #1, let alone popular in the U.S.
	
8. "Father Figure" - George Michael

	- Slow synth ballad
	- I really love those eastern scale runs on the synths; Nice to see some non-western music tools used in a pop song
	- Solid vocal work from Michael
	- Great chorus; that backup choir really makes it stand out
	
9. "Never Gonna Give You Up" - Rick Astley

	- IT'S THE RICKROLL SONG!!! This song's music video on YouTube has over 1 billion views. That may because of it's used in a very popular meme called a "Rickroll" which has been a popular meme for over a decade now
	- Anyway it's an upbeat synthpop song... and it's actually pretty good too!
	- Very catchy chorus; very infectious
	- Not too much to say here; just a real solid pop song
	
10. "Man in the Mirror" - Michael Jackson

	- Slow ballad about self-reflection and self-improvement
	- The movement of the melody is top notch; real good songwriting
	- Great chorus; especially with that backing choir
	- After the first chorus when that drum machine comes in... fantastic!
	- Wow, a good deployment of an "upward key-change" at the half-way point
	- This song's got one of the longest outros ever... and it's good! That low bass note with the backing choir complementing Jackson's improv is just fantastic

11. "Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car" - Billy Ocean

	- Upbeat Synthpop/Dance-pop song
	- As silly as the lyrics are, the performace of the chorus is really good; very catchy!
	- Solid sax work on this one
	- Another good "upward key-change"! Two in a row! Nice!
	
12. "Where Do Broken Hearts Go" - Whitney Houston

	- Slow ballad
	- Eh, this one's okay; nothing too special

13. "Wishing Well" - Terence Trent D'Arby

	- Funk song
	- That's one hell of a unique voice; so raspy yet powerful
	- It may sound a little silly, but I really do like those woodwinds after each chorus
	- It's nice and minimal; I like songs that do a lot with just a little!
	
14. "Anything for You" - Gloria Estefan & Miami Sound Machine

	- Slow ballad
	- Has a nice little classical guitar solo in it
	- Nothing too special; it's actually kinda boring If I'm honest
	
15. "One More Try" - George Michael

	- Very somber ballad
	- I really like that synth intro; so angelic
	- The song has this traditional pop '50s feel to it; I like it
	- Solid vocal work from Michael on this one; good range and control
	- The lyrics are kinda interesting; The whole song is basically "I will not love you. I've had my heart broken too many times to do this again" but then on the very last line, he caves in and say "maybe, just one more try"

16. "Together Forever" - Rick Astley

	- It's like a dollar-store version of "Never Gonna Give You Up" but in a minor-key
	- Honestly not that impressive; much less fun than his last hit
	
17. "Foolish Beat" - Debbie Gibson

	- Another boring and uninteresting pop ballad; another case of "how the hell did this go to #1?"
	
18. "Dirty Diana" - Michael Jackson

	- Whoa, this is one spooky intro
	- Oh man, that bass synth line combined with that gritty guitar riff... 
	- That's one hell of a guitar solo!
	- This is probably the grittiest song Michael Jackson has ever done; it's almost like a metal song

19. "The Flame" - Cheap Trick

	- Cheap Trick had a #1 hit? In 1988 of all years?!
	- It's power ballad, by the way
	- Meh, nothing too special; Pales in comparison to their earlier stuff from the '70s
	
20. "Hold On to the Nights" - Richard Marx

	- My God, can we go just a couple songs before we get ANOTHER slow, boring, and dawdling ballad?
	
21. "Roll With It" - Steve Winwood

	- This was the last #1 hit that Casey Kasem did for his "American Top 40" show, from 1970 to 1988
	- It's nice to hear some blues music after all of that synth we've heard so far this decade
	- It's a good song, but it's really nothing too special; just a solid blues song
	
22. "Monkey" - George Michael

	- Dance-pop song
	- Very catchy song; hard to not dance to
	- I really like that guitar that is sprinkled throughout; very nice and subtle
	- It's just a really good dance song
	
23. "Sweet Child O' Mine" - Guns N' Roses

	- Hard rock ballad
	- I've got a confession; I really don't like Guns N' Roses all that much. I just never got into them. However, I will admit that this is a good song. Well, at least compared to all the other pop hits
	- Great guitar riff, great chord progession, good lyrics, solid instrumentation. My only complaint is Axl Rose's voice. I just can't stand it!
	- Let's not ignore the absolute legendary guitar solo performed by Slash; outstanding virtuosity!

24. "Don't Worry Be Happy" - Bobby McFerrin

	- Reggae A capella song; featured in the flim "Cocktail"
	- Probably the most laid-back song every written; it's so care-free that I would imagine if you played this in your workplace, productivity would plummet
	- Just fantastic vocal work by McFerrin
	
25. "Love Bites" - Def Leppard

	- Power ballad
	- How did this become a #1 hit but not "Pour Some Sugar On Me"? That song is clearly the superior song, and it just missed the top spot at #2!
	- I'm mean it's not terrible, but it's really not that great either; if you listen to the album this song is on, there are many better songs than this one

26. "Red Red Wine" - UB40

	- Written by Neil Diamond, this reggae cover by UB40 was originally recorded in 1983, but found new popularity after being performed at Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday concert
	- This is probably the best Neil Diamond cover I've ever heard; this song was made to be a reggae song!

27. "A Groovy Kind of Love" - Phil Collins

	- Cover of The Mindbenders song from 1965; recorded for the film "Buster" starring Phil Collins
	- It's a good cover, but I don't think this song was made to be a soft, piano ballad. Phil does a good job translating it into one, but you can only do so much with it

28. "Kokomo" - The Beach Boys

	- Recorded for the film "Cocktail"
	- Ladies and Gentleman, THIS is what you get when The Beach Boys write a song WITHOUT Brian Wilson. A complete tragedy is what you get!
	- The caribbean theme is just so cheesy and the mixing is so poorly done, I can't believe The Beach Boys would sink this low whoring out their "surf & summer" image

29. "Wild, Wild West" - The Escape Club

	- Nothing more wild west cowboy than a London, UK band doing a pop rock song
	- It's kind of catchy, but the rap verses are just so cheesy and forced
	- I wil give the song credit for sounding like a '90s song while having the lyric "heading for the '90s, living in the wild, wild west"

30. "Bad Medicine" - Bon Jovi

	- Glam metal song
	- This just sounds so phoned-in; I guess this song's a classic to some, but it ain't to me
	
31. "Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley" - Will to Power

	- Synth-pop cover of the Peter Frampton song and the Lynyrd Skynyrd song
	- It's an okay cover; There's really nothing to special about it. I think what makes a good cover is when it feels like it's own song seperate from the original. However this just feels like a lazy synthpop cover which is what this song is

32. "Look Away" - Chicago

	- Power ballad; vocals performed by Bill Champlin
	- It feels so weird to hear a Chicago song without horns; it's like the lifeblood of the band
	- Honestly, it's not half-bad for a standard power ballad; I guess when your part of a band with extremely talent and seasoned musicians, you're a notch above most other groups doing power ballads

33. "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" - Poison

	- Glam rock/Acoustic power ballad
	- It's cool that even in 1988, a solid open-chord guitar song can reach #1
	- It's not too bad; Solid songwriting from Poison

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Red Red Wine" - UB40
2. "Sweet Child o' Mine" - Guns N' Roses

30. "Hold On to the Nights" - Richard Marx
31. "Foolish Beat" - Debbie Gibson
32. "Seasons Change" - Exposé
33. "Kokomo" - The Beach Boys

This was an okay year. Nothing really stood out all that much, but I will say that it's nice to see some variety this year. One more year left in this decade! Let's gooooooo!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1989
----

1. "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" - Poison

	- Glam rock/Acoustic power ballad
	- It's cool that even in 1988, a solid open-chord guitar song can reach #1
	- It's not too bad; Solid songwriting from Poison
	
2. "My Prerogative" - Bobby Brown

	- The first "New Jack Swing" song to reach #1; a sub-genre of R&B that was big in the '90s
	- I love the "mind your own damn business" attitude of the song; Hell yeah! Tell 'em what for!
	- The main synth riff is just too damn funky; plue that percussion section is top-notch
	- I feel like this is the natural continuation of the kind of Funk and R&B that Stevie Wonder did in the '70s; I like it!

3. "Two Hearts" - Phil Collins

	- Another single written for the film "Buster"
	- An upbeat pop song; similar to the style of pop from the early Motown era
	- Fantastic songwriting and composition; not to mention Collin's fantastic vocal performance
	- Just a solid pop song; doesn't drags on and doesn't feel forced
	
4. "When I'm With You" - Sheriff
	
	- Power ballad; originally recorded in 1982, but re-released in 1988
	- It's okay I guess; it kind of drags on and doesn't have much going for it
	
5. "Straight Up" - Paula Abdul

	- New Jack Swing song
	- Extremely upbeat; I really love those little flourishes on the synth throughout the song
	- I do think the little electric flute thing at the end is kinda cheesy; but it could be worse
	
6. "Lost in Your Eyes" - Debbie Gibson

	- Piano ballad
	- It's an okay song; I will say that I'm impressed by the songwriting. She was only 18-years-old, ands she wrote and composed the whole song!

7. "The Living Years" - Mike + The Mechanics

	- Wow, another Genesis member with a solo career #1 hit!
	- Soft rock ballad about a son regretting not having a good relationship with his now deceased father
	- It's neat seeing the prog rock influence in how Mick Rutherford writes a song, but there really isn't anything special about this song. I will say it's better than most othe ballads, but it can only go so far with it

8. "Eternal Flame" - The Bangles

	- Minimal soft rock ballad
	- It's not half-bad; Well composed and performed. Can't say it's amazing or anything, but it's a nice song to listen to

9. "The Look" - Roxette

	- Upbeat pop rock song; very guitar driven
	- I really love that rhythm-section; the bass and drums work together so well
	- I really how rhythmic the vocals are on the verses; it really helps drive the song along that rhythm-section
	- Also that "na, na, na, na, na!" section is really catchy! Especially when it stops for a second before going back into it!
	
10. "She Drive Me Crazy" - Fine Young Cannibals

	- Upbeat pop rock song
	- I really love that Drop-D guitar tuning; really makes this song sound heavy
	- I actually like the high falsetto on the vocals; really suits the song well
	- That slinky guitar in the middle of the song is so damn funky!
	
11. "Like a Prayer" - Madonna

	- Another upbeat pop rock song; this one's go a bit of a religious feel to it
	- It's hard to hate the church organ and choir in the back of the mix; I've always like the sound of those
	- The chorus is also pretty catchy as well
	- Nice little minor-key breakdown in the middle

12. "I'll Be There For You" - Bon Jovi

	- Power ballad; this one's got a sitar!
	- I like the breadth of instrumentation in this song; really livens-up the song to be more than just a standard power ballad
	- Solid composition and performance from all involved

13. "Forever Your Girl" - Paula Abdul

	- Upbeat synthpop song
	- What's up with that sax? It barrels into the song like a dump truck through drywall!
	- It's not a half-bad pop song; It's pleasant to listen to, but it's nothing too special

16. "Rock On" - Michael Damian

	- Cover of am old glam rock song from 1973; originally written by David Essex
	- Nice guitar work in the middle and towards the end
	- It's a solid cover, but I like the original better

15. "Wind Beneath My Wings" - Bette Midler

	- Slow ballad; recorded for the film "Beaches" starring Bette Midler
	- It's not half-bad; solid composition and performance. I really don't know why it has the legacy it does

16. "I'll Be Loving You (Forever)" - New Kids on the Block

	- Oh boy, here we go. First boy band #1 hit song!
	- This one's a slow love ballad; and it's really not that great. There's hardly any passion in any of the performances, and it kind of drags on for over 4 minutes

17. "Satisfied" - Richard Marx

	- Upbeat dance rock song
	- Solid guitar work on this song; suits the song well
	- Great chorus; very catchy
	
18. "Baby Don't Forget My Number" - Milli Vanilli

	- Everybody's fake German vocal group; but let's put that aside and judge the song for what it is
	- It's nice and upbeat; very cheery
	- The rap-vocals are kinda cheesy; wish they took a more serious approach to the vocals
	- It's okay; I can't hate it
	
19. "Good Thing" - Fine Young Cannibals

	- Boogie-woogie song
	- I really love that guitar intro; so abrupt as to say "Hey! listen to this song!"
	- Great chorus; kind of singable too!
	- That boogie-woogie piano solo in the middle is just fantastic
	
20. "If You Don't Know Me by Now" - Simply Red 

	- Cover of the Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes song from 1972
	- I actually like this better than the original; I like how stripped-down the song is with very little instrumentation. Let's the vocals stand out better
	- Solid vocal performance; can't complain
	
21. "Toy Soldiers" - Martika

	- Soft rock ballad; sampled in the 2005 Eminem song "Like Toy Soldiers"
	- I really like that chorus; it's so powerful, but I can't say the verses are that great though
	- Not a half-bad guitar solo in the middle

22. "Batdance" - Prince

	- Written for the Tim Burton film "Batman"
	- This is the single weirdiest pop song I've heard reach #1; It's like one big experimental song that doesn't have any verses, choruses, or bridges. It's just kind of a Frankenstein's monster of riffs and samples from the film
	- I will say that it is insane funky, every little guitar bit is just so well done
	- Okay, this has probably Prince's best guitar solo; It's so friggin heavy and gritty
	- The middle section has this mid-tempo, slinky funk guitar. It's so good
	- I will say the film samples are pretty forced into the song; doesn't really work that well

23. "Right Here Waiting" - Richard Marx
	
	- Soft rock piano ballad
	- Nice to see some classical guitar in a pop song; very underrated insturment
	- It's not a half-bad piano ballad; can't say it's anything too special
	
24. "Cold Hearted" - Paula Abdul

	- Another upbeat New Jack Swing song
	- This one's okay; it's catchy enough, but there's not much else to it
	
25. "Hangin' Tough" - New Kids on the Block

	- There's just something funny about listening to some teeny boppers try and sound tough
	- The rap vocals just can't help but sound tacky
	- I will say that it is well-composed; They really tried their best to make the instrumentation sound "tough"
	- Not a half-bad guitar solo in the middle
	
26. "Don't Wanna Lose You" - Gloria Estefan

	- Slow ballad
	- It's not bad, but it's just kinda "meh"; not much else to say about this one
	
27. "Girl I'm Gonna Miss You" - Milli Vanilli

	- Smoooooth ballad
	- Another case of cheesy rap lyrics; they really just can't help themselves can they?
	- The chorus is kinda bland; I guess they tried to add some backing vocals, but it's really not all that great
	- I will give credit to the fact that they used an honest-to-God clarinet in the song!
	
28. "Miss You Much" - Janet Jackson

	- Man, we really are missing people a lot these last few weeks, eh?
	- Okay, this one's kinda gritty; the percussion and sampling sounds like an industrial zone
	- That grittinest carries into the vocals during the chorus; amazing!
	- This is probably the heaviest you can get with a standard pop song; I'm impressed that Jackson was willing to push into that direction!

29. "Listen to Your Heart" - Roxette

	- Power ballad
	- Not half-bad; well composed and sounds better than most power ballads we've heard so far
	- There's even a decent guitar solo in the middle!
	- Wow, a key-change that isn't just up a half-step! and it sounds really natural!
	
30. "When I See You Smile" - Bad English

	- Glam metal power ballad; lead vocals by John Waite
	- Not too bad of a guitar solo
	- It's got a decent chorus and Waite's vocals are decent also; can't say much else about the song
	
	
31. "Blame It on the Rain" - Milli Vanilli

	- I will this one's a lot more catchy and upbeat then the other hits they've had so far
	- This one's actually not half-bad; It doesn't have any forced rap vocals and everyone's performace is good
	
32. "We Didn't Start the Fire" - Billy Joel

	- This is quite an interesting song; it basically chronicles a whole bunch of world events from 1949 to 1989 with each lyric; very clever!
	- The cadence of the verse lyrics are just soooo good!
	- Also that chorus is really damn catchy! "We didn't start the fire! It was always burnin' since the world's been turnin'!"

33. "Another Day in Paradise" - Phil Collins

	- The final #1 hit of the '80s, can Phil Collins deliver?
	- ...yes he can! This is probably his best #1 hit song; it's a song about the homeless, and he knocks it out of the park
	- The spooky intro with that reverberated snare is just perfect
	- That laid back rhythm with those synth leads are amazing; real sets the mood for the song
	- I really like those subtle acoustic guitar bits throughout; so nice to listen to

33. "I'll Be Loving You (Forever)" - New Kids on the Block

A pretty solid year; It's nice that we are ending this decade on a strong note. I know that the '90s had a pretty diverse bit of pop music, so I look forward to what's in store!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1990
----

1. "Another Day in Paradise" - Phil Collins

	- The final #1 hit of the '80s, can Phil Collins deliver?
	- ...yes he can! This is probably his best #1 hit song; it's a song about the homeless, and he knocks it out of the park
	- The spooky intro with that reverberated snare is just perfect
	- That laid back rhythm with those synth leads are amazing; real sets the mood for the song
	- I really like those subtle acoustic guitar bits throughout; so nice to listen to

2. "How Am I Supposed to Live Without You" - Michael Bolton

	- "Michael Bolton? Like the pop singer? What's your favorite song of his?"
	- "I dunno... I guess I sort of like 'em all."
	- "I celebrate the guy's entire catalogue!"
	- If you haven't seen the movie "Office Space" you need to do that immediately
	- Anyway, this is a cover of a love ballad from 1983; originally done by Laura Branigan
	- It's okay I guess; nothing too special
	
3. "Opposites Attract" - Paula Abdul with The Wild Pair

	- Abdul pairs up with a hip-hop duo on this one
	- It's really funky; solid work with the drum machine and synths
	- Honestly, The Wild Pair is better half of this song; Abdul's peroformance feels phoned-in
	- That's not saying much though; The Wild Pair is kinda cheesy during the rap parts
	
4. "Escapade" - Janet Jackson

	- That drone in the background is kinda spooky during the intro
	- The pre-chorus and chorus are pretty solid; especially with those stacked vocals
	- I'm surprised. I thought Janet Jackson would just be another standard female pop singer from this era, but her songs have a bit of an edge; I like it

5. "Black Velvet" - Alannah Myles

	- Bluesy rock song about Elvis Presley
	- That rhythm is so down-lown and filthy; I love it
	- Solid vocal performance from Myles, I really like the chorus too!
	- Great guitar solo in the middle
	
6. "Love Will Lead You Back" - Taylor Dayne

	- Slow love ballad
	- It's okay; the performace from Dayne is good for the most part, but the song is pretty bog standard

7. "I'll Be Your Everything" - Tommy Page

	- Another slow love ballad
	- This one's even more underwhelming than the last; hardly an passion in this one
	
8. "Nothing Compares 2 U" - Sinéad O'Connor

	- My God, THREE slow love ballads in a row! 1990 just won't let up, will it?
	- Actually, this one's REAL good! It's written by Prince and performed by an Irish artist
	- That synth chord progression is great; very angelic sounding
	- When those drums come in; it's just soooo good; The beat is basic but effective
	- Great vocal performace by O'Connor and those backing vocals are chilling
	
9. "Vogue" - Madonna

	- This is probably our first '90s dance song #1 hit; it basically sounds exactly like you think it does
	- I really like the bassline under the mix
	- Can't say I like the rap verse towards the end; it's just so forced
	- This is one of those "Greatest songs of the '90s" you see on countdown lists, and I really don't see why. Sorry, but this ain't it, chief

10. "Hold On" - Wilson Phillips

	- Pop rock ballad
	- This one's just real boring and forgettable; can't say much else
	
11. "It Must Have Been Love" - Roxette

	- Another pop rock ballad
	- This one's okay; really nothing too special about this one
	
12. "Step by Step" - New Kids On The Block

	- This one's nice and upbeat
	- It's nice to hear a song that isn't slow and boring, but this song is also nothing too special; it just kind of drags on
	- I guess the "Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc." vocal lines are unique with each singer taking a turn

13. "She Ain't Worth It" - Glenn Medeiros feat. Bobby Brown

	- New Jack Swing song, Bobby Brown returns; can he live up to his last hit?
	- ...not really. This one's okay, but it really lacks that punch that "My Prerogative" has. Also, he's only a feature on this song, so probably he had very little to do with this one

14. "Vision of Love" - Mariah Carey

	- Here we go; first Mariah Carey #1 hit of God knows how many in her career
	- Solid vocal performance on this one; her voice really carries the song
	- My God, she's got one hell of a register; really hitting those high, high notes!
	
15. "If Wishes Came True" - Sweet Sensation

	- This is another case of "slow, boring, nothing too special"
	- I guess the guitar solo's okay
	
16. "Blaze Of Glory" - Jon Bon Jovi

	- First and only #1 hit for Jon Bon Jovi as a solo artist
	- Sort of a hard rock/blue rock song; I like the low tuning on the bass. It really adds a punch to the pre-verses
	- Chorus is okay; It's probably the more recognizable part of the song, but everything around it is much better
	- Not a half-bad guitar solo
	
17. "Release Me" - Wilson Phillips

	- Very similar to their last #1 hit; I will say this one's a little bit better, not nearly as boring, and better performed
	- Good vocal harmonies during the chorus

18. "(Can't Live Without Your) Love and Affection" - Nelson

	- Glam metal song
	- Oh shit, is that an acoustic 12-string guitar I hear? Okay, that knocks this one up a notch or two
	- I really like that chorus; it kind of reminds me of "Take Me Home Tonight" by Eddie Money
	- Not a half-bad guitar solo too!
	
19. "Close To You" - Maxi Priest

	- Song by English Reggae artist; more of an R&B song
	- It's got a really solid rhythm section; very upbeat
	- It's an okay song; nothing too special about it
	
20. "Praying for Time" - George Michael

	- Michael's performace is good, but the song itself kind of drags on for nearly 5 minutes; barely any changes throughout the whole song
	- Hell, even the verses and choruses sound the same

21. "I Don't Have the Heart" - James Ingram

	- Slow R&B ballad
	- Not a bad performace from Ingram, but it's very repetitive
	- I guess I like the use of strings in the song; those are nice to hear

22. "Black Cat" - Janet Jackson

	- Whoa, is this a METAL song?!
	- Well, it's basically Janet Jackson, but with a metal guitar
	- The main guitar riff is very tasty; especially when they hit those pinch harmonics. So good!
	- Very good chorus; solid work from all involved
	- Great guitar solo too! Kind of reminds me of the guitar solo from "Beat It" from her brother Michael
	
23. "Ice Ice Baby" - Vanilla Ice

	- This is the first "official" hip-hop song to reach #1, at least according to Billboard magazine
	- Shamelessly stole the bassline from "Under Pressure" by Queen & David Bowie with no credit to them
	- The melody and rhythm are top-notch; but the lyrics and delivery from Vanilla Ice is so comical; it's like a parody of a rap song instead of an actual rap song
	- I can guarantee that Vanilla Ice has NEVER done any of the criminal activity he brags about in this song
	- If you want to listen to a good Vanilla Ice song, you should check out the "Ninja Rap", written for the film "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze". At least that song is tongue-in-cheek!

24. "Love Takes Time" - Mariah Carey

	- Slow R&B ballad
	- Another case of "slow and boring but the singer makes up for it with their talent"

25. "I'm Your Baby Tonight" - Whitney Houston

	- An upbeat minor-key R&B song
	- It nice to see Houston growing a bit of an edge to her songs
	- Great vocal performace from Houston, as always
	- However, this song really isn't anything too special; It's refreshing to hear, but don't get too excited

26. "Because I Love You (The Postman Song)" - Stevie B

	- Slow pop ballad
	- My God, I'm gonna fall asleep listening to this; How the hell was this at #1 for FOUR weeks!?

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Nothing Compares 2 U" - Sinéad O'Connor

21. "If Wishes Came True" - Sweet Sensation
22. "Hold On" - Wilson Phillips
23. "I'll Be Your Everything" - Tommy Page
24. "Because I Love You (The Postman Song)" - Stevie B

Wow, we starting this decade with a whimper. It was either a boring ballad or just an "okay" song; even the good songs lacked that "umph" that a lot of the past #1 hits had. I REALLY hope next year is much better.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1991
----

1. "Justify My Love" - Madonna

	- Whoa, this sounds kinda like a Massive Attack song
	- That drum machine with those bass notes and synth leads is just top notch production!
	- I would say this a great song, but it suffers from the same flaw of lyrics that "(You're) Having My Baby" by Paul Anka has. You can either make it wholesome like how Loggins & Mesina do with their song "Danny's Song" or even romantic like how Marvin Gaye does on "Let's Get it On", but this comes off as trashy and kinda creepy, honestly

2. "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" - Janet Jackson

	- Wow, another well-produced single from Jackson!
	- Another case, of "gritty rhythm-section"... that's a good thing by the way
	- It's important to note that this record was produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, the same guys who produced "Human" by the Human League, so you know this is gonna be a good song!

3. "The First Time" - Surface

	- Slow R&B song
	- Bah, another generic love ballad; it's basically indistinguishable from the mountain of the previous #1 hits that sound like this

4. "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" - C+C Music Factory feat. Freedom Williams

	- '90s dance track
	- Those distorted guitar chord samples that make up the main riff are just great; the way that they "stab" was a great idea
	- I like how there's a nice and colorful, and diverse of percussion in the song; really makes the song a lot fuller
	- Oh, and then those guitar "stabs" are given a reverb effect around the mid-point; just great work
	- There's a lot more I can say about this song, but I'll just leave it at this: it's a very-well made dance song.

5. "All the Man That I Need" - Whitney Houston

	- Slow R&B song
	- This is probably Houston's weakest performance; usually her vocals would lift the unimaginative composition to at-least "decent" but here, but I'm just not feeling it this time
	
6. "Someday" - Mariah Carey

	- Upbeat Dance-pop song
	- On top of Carey's vocal range, she's also got great vocal control on this one
	- Nice little guitar solo in the middle; unexpected, but a welcome addition
	- Not a half-bad song for sure
	
7. "One More Try" - Timmy T

	- Wow, this is gotta be one of the lamest productions I've ever heard. It's like the producer picked the cheesiest effects to build the composition and called it a day
	- There is an insane amount of dissonance listening to a white guy sing all smooth to a poorly-made rap beat
	- Oh yeah, and the lyrics are also pretty boring too
	
8. "Coming Out of the Dark" - Gloria Estefan

	- Slow pop song; kinda has a gospel feel to it
	- There's not much going for this song; but the backing choir does a good job of keeping this song from being too bland
	- Not too bad; I wouldn't mind if it came on the radio or at a big-box store
	
9. "I've Been Thinking About You" - Londonbeat

	- Eurodance song; made for the clubs of London, England
	- I kinda like the little guitar break in the middle; it's neat to hear that in a dance song
	- I dunno, it's an okay song; the vocal performance sounds real weird
	
10. "You're In Love" - Wilson Phillips

	- I like the vocal harmonies on this one; especially during the chorus
	- This one's also fairly indistinguishable from their previous #1 hits, but this one's the better of the bunch

11. "Baby, Baby" - Amy Grant

	- I will say this song's got a real nice synth lead; but did they really have to go with the electric bells SFX?
	- The synth break in the middle has a nice little funky quality to it; I like it
	- Another "okay" song

12. "Joyride" - Roxette

	- This one feels like a spiritual successor to "The Look" from 1989
	- Great triplet rhythm with the drums and bass
	- Real solid guitar work on this one; very bluesy
	- Great bridge; very upbeat and catchy
	
13. "I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)" - Hi-Five

	- Mid-tempo R&B song
	- The Roland drum machine just dominates this song soooo hard
	- It's actually pretty well done; the harmonies are good, the performances are good, just an all-round solid love R&B song

14. "I Don't Wanna Cry" - Mariah Carey

	- Slow R&B song with a spanish flamenco feel to it
	- Solid vocal work on the chorus
	- Not too bad, but that that amazing either
	
15. "More Than Words" - Extreme

	- Acoustic guitar love ballad
	- Solid guitar chord progression
	- Amazing vocal harmonies; not to mention the great vocal range of Gary Cherone
	- I never thought I'd heard a shred solo on an acoustic guitar
	- It's just a great song overall; it's simplicity is it's greatest strength

16. "Rush Rush" - Paula Abdul

	- Slow Pop song; another case of heavy Roland drum machine usage
	- I really like the low bass tuning; really fills the low-end of the mix well
	- Oh wow, a violin solo. Not only that, but it's pretty good!
	- Not a half-bad song overall

17. "Unbeliveable" - EMF

	- An upbeat pop rock/rave song; part of a music movement from Manchester, England call "Madchester"
	- Damn, that's one hell of a bassline!
	- The rap verses are actually not too bad; it actually fits the song pretty well
	- I love that "Ohhhhh, what the fuck?!" sample used through the song. I imagine that a lot of people back then and even today don't even recognize it!
	- Oh yeah, there's even a banger of a guitar solo at the end too!
	
18. "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You" - Bryan Adams

	- Canadian soft rock ballad; featured in the film "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"
	- Pretty solid piano chord progression; everything is pretty well-crafted
	- The movemments betweens sections are also pretty good
	- This song was a MASSIVE international hit... and I have no clue as to why. This isn't a bad song by any means, but it's far from some legendary song

19. "The Promise of a New Day" - Paula Abdul

	- This one's got a mystic quality to it; I like it
	- It's a solid song in of itself, but it is a little repetitive

20. "I Adore Mi Amor" - Color Me Badd

	- Wow, okay. We are coming out of the gate with the a cappella, aren't we?
	- Besides the fantastic vocal harmonies from all involved, this song is just "okay"; not a whole lot going for this song
	
21. "Good Vibrations" - Marky Mark & The Funky Bunch feat. Loleatta Holloway

	- Hip-hop song from Mark Wahlberg, the older brother Donnie Wahlberf, one of the members of New Kids on the Block
	- Oh yeah, I guess he's also an insanely successful actor as well
	- I think the best part of this song is the Holloway sample; either than that, it's an okay song. I do think it's better than "Ice Ice Baby" so when it comes to ranking white-guy rapping songs, he's #1 of 2 songs so far
	
22. "Emotions" - Mariah Carey

	- An upbeat R&B song; heavily influence from disco. Kinda sounds like "Best of My Love" by The Emotions
	- This is probably the highest I've ever heard someone sing on a pop record; it's like a tea kettle going off
	- Just a well-made song; not much else to say
	
23. "Romantic" - Karyn White

	- Another song produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis
	- It would be a better song if there wasn't all this stuff going on in this song; it;s just a very muddled mix with just the vocals standing out
	
24. "Cream" - Prince & The New Power Generation

	- I really like that solid 4-on-the-floor rhythm and that snare drum has one of the best tones I've ever heard
	- I also really like those little guitar bits throughout the whole song; both the wahguitar and clean guitar
	- A solid chorus; very bluesy and catchy
	- This song is just so... "spunky"... if you know what I mean
	
25. "When a Man Loves a Woman" - Michael Bolton

	- Cover of the #1 hit by Percy Sledge from 1966
	- It's a faithful cover; nothing much else to say. This might as well have been released a decade or two before, it probably would have still been a #1 hit

26. "Set Adrift on Memory Bliss" - P.M. Dawn

	- Alternative hip hop song; samples "True" by Spandau Ballet as well as some other older pop songs
	- I REALLY REALLY like this; This reminds me A Tribe Called Quest sooo much. They're from New Jersey so they probably were in the same rap scene as them
	- Those dissonant chiming bells that ring throughout the song are just great
	- The sampling, the rhythm-section, the rap flow, the backing vocal harmonies; they're perfect. How the hell was this a #1 hit song? I think we have another "Frankenstein at #1" moment in the American pysche

27. "Black or White" - Michael Jackson

	- Song celebrating interracial relationships/racial harmony
	- Insanely catchy; especially with that guitar riff and Michael's vocal cadence
	- Holy shit, that breakdown in the middle is so damn heavy! and it came out of nowhere!
	- It's insane how after nearly three decades, Michael Jackson managed to change with the times and write really good songs to fit those times

A much better year! Even the stuff that consider "boring" from this year had a charm to it (with the exception of "One More Try"). There was also an insane amount of variety this time around. I never thought I'd hear a glam metal ballad, a soft rock ballad, a britpop song, and a sophisticated alt rap song in the same year. I can only hope that we keep this variety throughout the decade.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1992
----

1. "Black or White" - Michael Jackson

	- Song celebrating interracial relationships/racial harmony
	- Insanely catchy; especially with that guitar riff and Michael's vocal cadence
	- Holy shit, that breakdown in the middle is so damn heavy! and it came out of nowhere!
	- It's insane how after nearly three decades, Michael Jackson managed to change with the times and write really good songs to fit those times

2. "All 4 Love" - Color Me Badd

	- Very upbeat; sounds like it's influenced from the early motown and '60s pop
	- Great vocal harmonies from all involved
	- Just a good, happy song; not a single grey cloud on this one
	
3. "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" - George Michael & Elton John

	- Song originally written and recorded by John in 1974; first performed with Michael at Live Aid in 1985, and then again for this single in 1991
	- Michael takes over on lead vocals for this one; For the most part his voice is faithful to the original performed by John
	- I mean, it's basically indistinguishable from the original, barring the obvious inclusion of Michael
	- It's a good song; not much else to say

4. "I'm Too Sexy" - Right Said Fred

	- British Dance pop song
	- Very tongue-in-cheek; They clearly weren't taking themselves too seriously on this song
	- That "I do my little turn on the catwalk!" lyric is friggin' hilarious; too funny to not laugh at
	- Besides the novelty factor, it's just a well-made dance song; doesn't go on for too long and his interesting the whole time

5. "To Be With You" - Mr. Big

	- Even this late in the game, we were still getting glam rock bands doing love ballads and reaching #1
	- By the way, the guitarist for this band, Paul Glibert, is a pretty cool dude and like.... REALLY good at guitar
	- Great chorus; very singable and catchy
	- Another honest-to-God acoustic guitar solo!

6. "Save The Best For Last" - Vanessa Williams

	- Slow pop ballad
	- No, this is NOT the pro tennis player
	- Meh, slow boring song; nothing really special about it
	
7. "Jump" - Kris Kross

	- First G-Funk/Rap #1 hit; song done by two adolescent boys
	- It's got all of the staples of a G-Funk or Gangsta Rap song from the '90s, but it's very G-rated and kid-friendly
	- I will say, they are pretty good. It's a solid song with good flows and performances

8. "I'll Be There" - Mariah Carey feat. Trey Lorenz

	- Cover of the Jackson 5 #1 hit from 1970
	- I actually like this one much better then the original. The '90s R&B aesthetic fits this song much better
	- Besides Carey's great vocal performance, Lorenz's vocals also knocks it out of the park as well!

9. "Baby Got Back" - Sir Mix-a-Lot

	- Rap song about big butts
	- The valley-girl intro is so tacky; also she's racist as hell haha (I know, it's joke)
	- It's so in-your-face with the lyrics that it actually makes it amazing; There's absolutely no subtlety here. and I love it
	- I'm absolutely floored by the amount of creative ways one could say they like large asses; I never heard this song past the intro until now
	- Oh yeah, and the song's composition is great too

10. "This Used to Be My Playground" - Madonna

	- Song written for the baseball film "A League of Their Own"
	- Nothing much to see here folks; just another slow, boring pop song that drags on for too long
	
11. "End Of the Road" - Boyz II Men

	- This monster of a song was #1 for 13 consectutive weeks; breaking the previous record held by "Physical" by Olivia Newton-John by 4 weeks! Wow, so does it stack up?
	- ...it absolutely does. Ladies and Gentlemen... THIS is how you do an all-singer R&B group. Buttery smooth harmonies, great chord progessions, a nice variety of vocal timbre between each singer, and powerful deliveries from all
	- That pre-chorus is just amazing; it builds up to one hell of a chorus
	- I will say, the premise of this song is so weird... like dude, just dump her and move on. She isn't going to be loyal to you.

12. "How Do You Talk to an Angel" - The Heights

	- Pop rock song; TV theme for the short-lived show "The Heights"
	- Alright, if you are going to make a TV theme, it needs to be exciting and upbeat. This dawdling, mid-tempo song can't decide if it wants to be happy or sad

13. "I Will Always Love You" - Whitney Houston

	- Originally written by Dolly Parton in 1973; this cover was recorded for the film "The Bodyguard"
	- Okay, that didn't take long. This song was at #1 for 14 consectutive weeks, beating out "The End Of the Road" by just 1 week. Does THIS stack up?
	- ...eh, not really. I know this is going againist the grain, but this song's just "meh". It's basically just a standard slow pop ballad, but it does have that insane key-change where she goes "and IIIIIIIIIII" which is quite impressive vocally, but that's really the only memorable part

OVERALL RANKING

1. "End Of the Road" - Boyz II Men
2. "Black or White" - Michael Jackson
3. "I'm Too Sexy" - Right Said Fred
4. "Baby Got Back" - Sir Mix-a-Lot
5. "All 4 Love" - Color Me Badd
6. "To Be With You" - Mr. Big
7. "Jump" - Kris Kross
8. "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" - George Michael & Elton John
9. "I'll Be There" - Mariah Carey feat. Trey Lorenz
10. "I Will Always Love You" - Whitney Houston
11. "Save The Best For Last" - Vanessa Williams
12. "How Do You Talk to an Angel" - The Heights
13. "This Used to Be My Playground" - Madonna

Wow, okay. I guess Americans in 1992 didn't get too bored of the same song that much. Only 13 songs this year reached #1; it took me less than an hour to listen to all of these! I really wish I could say this was a good or bad year, but I really can't since there just wasn't enough #1 hits to make a decision. If I had a "good", "meh", and "bad" tier-list for this project, 1992 would go into the "I dunno" catagory.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1993
----

1. "I Will Always Love You" - Whitney Houston

	- Originally written by Dolly Parton in 1973; this cover was recorded for the film "The Bodyguard"
	- Okay, that didn't take long. This song was at #1 for 14 consectutive weeks, beating out "The End Of the Road" by just 1 week. Does THIS stack up?
	- ...eh, not really. I know this is going againist the grain, but this song's just "meh". It's basically just a standard slow pop ballad, but it does have that insane key-change where she goes "and IIIIIIIIIII" which is quite impressive vocally, but that's really the only memorable part

2. "A Whole New World" - Peabo Bryson & Regina Belle

	- A slow R&B cover of the Disney song from "Aladdin"
	- This was always one of my favorite Disney songs, so I might be biased in saying that "It's good"
	- It's pretty faithful to the orginal from the film, but I'd still pick the film version sung by the actors over this one

3. "Informer" - Snow

	- A Hip-hop/Reggae crossover hit; sung by a white guy from Canada
	- This guy's got an insane flow; he's like a proto Eminem or Tech n9ne
	- Honestly, I actually like this one. It's just a well-made song through and through; not much else to say
	- You know, it's funny how people wrote this guy off as another Vanilla Ice, but he actually grew up "in the hood" in Toronto and probably did do all the things he said he did. Also one of the reasons why he never took off in the US past this song was because he was barred from entering the country due to an attempted murder charge in Canada, so he couldn't really capitalize on his success all that much

4. "Freak Me" - Silk

	- Slow R&B song
	- The smooth R&B production and the "seductive" lyrical peroformance DO NOT mix AT ALL
	- Also, these lyrics are so cheesy; another case of trying to sound seductive while actually coming off as creepy
	- It's like listening to a dollar-store knock-off of Boys II Men
	
5. "That's The Way Love Goes" - Janet Jackson

	- longest #1 hit for the Jackson family; topped the chart for 8 consectutive weeks
	- Cool, another Trip-Hop sounding song!
	- This time, it's a lot better then Madonna's attempt on "Justify My Love"
	- Overall, this one's not too bad; but it's nothing too special
	
6. "Weak" - SWV

	- Smooth R&B all-girl vocal group
	- "Weak" huh? Is that a self-admittance of the song's quality, SWV?
	- In all seriousness, it's not bad but it really lacks the character a lot of other vocal groups have

7. "(I Can't Help) Falling In Love" - UB40

	- Dance pop cover of the famous Elvis Presley song from 1961
	- I like this cover. It takes the more intimate original and adds a more upbeat, optimistic quality to it

8. "Dreamlover" - Mariah Carey

	- Upbeat R&B song
	- Such a solid chord progession; the kind that puts you in a good mood
	- I really like that chorus; it's so catchy and well-done
	- Really good vocal harmonies throughout
	- The mixing and production quality is top-notch; it sounds like a song you'd hear in the 21th century

9. "I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)" - Meat Loaf

	- Off of his comeback album "Bat Out Of Hell II: Back into Hell"
	- Okay, THIS has to be the last '80s power ballad. It's already 1993 for crying out loud!
	- Since this is a Meat Loaf song, you can bet your ass it's gonna be a massive rock opera of a song
	- I know it's the chorus that everyone loves, but I think everything else around it is better; especially those fast sections
	- Honestly, I think this is a downgrade to his work on "Bat Out of Hell", less catchy and more melodramatic

10. "Again" - Janet Jackson

	- Slow R&B piano ballad
	- It's not a bad song by any means, but I do think Janet is better off doing the more upbeat songs instead; leave the ballads to other folks
	- The String arrangement at the end is kinda neat though

11. "Hero" - Mariah Carey

	- Slow R&B ballad; two in a row!
	- Nice lyrics; it's always cool to see a song with a good message
	- It is a pretty standard ballad, but it is a lot better than most. Carey's vocal performance is top-notch as always and the composition and mixing also very good as well

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Dreamlover" - Mariah Carey
2. "(I Can't Help) Falling In Love" - UB40
3. "Informer" - Snow
4. "A Whole New World" - Peabo Bryson & Regina Belle
5. "Hero" - Mariah Carey
6. "I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)" - Meat Loaf
7. "I Will Always Love You" - Whitney Houston
8. "Again" - Janet Jackson
9. "That's The Way Love Goes" - Janet Jackson
10. "Weak" - SWV
11. "Freak Me" - Silk

Never mind what I said about 1992. THIS was the year people didn't get bored. only 11 songs topped the chart this year. Wow. I will say that this year was a little bit less as enjoyable as last year, but even then this one's another "I dunno" year for me.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1994
----

1. "Hero" - Mariah Carey

	- Slow R&B ballad; two in a row!
	- Nice lyrics; it's always cool to see a song with a good message
	- It is a pretty standard ballad, but it is a lot better than most. Carey's vocal performance is top-notch as always and the composition and mixing also very good as well
	
2. "All for Love" - Brian Adams / Rod Stewart / Sting

	- Soft rock ballad written for the film "The Three Musketeers"
	- I just realized how similar these guy's voices are
	- Despite the similarities between their voices, they manage to stand out from each other with those harmonies
	- It's not half-bad; I actually like it. I guess that's what you get when you take 3 very talented musicians and have them work together on a song

3. "The Power of Love" - Céline Dion

	- Cover of the 1984 Jennifer Rush song
	- Slow love ballad
	- Wow, she's got one hell of a voice; very powerful
	- Usually I would say that this is a standard love ballad, but her voice makes it half-decent. However, I think her voice supercedes that and makes this song great. Probably the best female vocalist I've heard so far!

4. "The Sign" - Ace of Base

	- Europop group from Sweden; This is probably the most '90s sounding song ever written
	- I really like the fuse of Reggae and Europop on this one; it sounds like a solid combo of genres
	- I like how the sections without vocals are eerie and spooky but then it kicks into the major-key happy vocal sections
	- Very catchy chorus
	- It's pretty standard song, but not a second is wasted to ensure that the song is catchy at all times

5. "Bump n' Grind" - R. Kelly

	- Man, this guy has fallen from grace now, hasn't he? However, let's put all that aside and see if his music is good in of itself
	- The funny thing is that this song is trying to be smooth and sexy, but R. Kelly is like screaming into the microphone. I can just picture him putting up his mouth up to woman's ear to whisper something only to scream as loudly as possible
	- I will say his voice is pretty good here; kind of a little over-the-top, but he's got chops

6. "I Swear" - All-4-One

	- Originally performed by Country musician John Michael Montgomery; I actually remember hearing only the country version for so long, I didn't even realize that there was an R&B version
	- Not much to say; it's a faithful cover and is well-performed. However, I still prefer the original

7. "Stay (I Missed You)" - Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories
	
	- Wow, first time we've seen a folk song reach #1 in a while; this is one of those anomalies to reach #1 with a weird story
	- Originally recorded for the film "Reality Bites"; this was the first song to reach #1 of an artist that didn't have a record label. The starring actor of the film, Ethan Hawke, was her neighbor and invited her to record her song for the film
	- Those ascending guitar arpeggios are just so good; so somber yet uplifting
	- The way the song build up with the instrumentation is great composition; especially with those harmonized backing vocals
	- The whole song has this cautious optimism about it; can't say I've heard any songs with this feel so far

8. "I'll Make Love To You" - Boyz II Men

	- Another massive hit for Boys II Men; this time 14 consectutive weeks at #1 tying Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You"
	- Their vocal harmonies are on point once again; hard to say anything bad
	- Fantastic composition; especially when that bridge section kicks in
	- They really do knock this one out of the park; I will say that I liked "End Of The Road" better

9. "On Bended Knee" - Boyz II Men

	- First time an artist replaced itself at the top spot since The Beatles in 1964
	- A much more tamer performance this time around; unlike the massive epic songs they've had reach #1, this one's much more restrained
	- I really wish I could say something that hasn't already been said; it's just a good song in of itself

10. "Here Comes the Hotstepper" - Ini Kamoze

	- Jamaican dancehall song fused with hip hop
	- Insanely funky; that bassline with the record scratches is top-notch
	- Kamoze's flow and patois fit together so well here; it makes the song so much more catchy
	- That chorus with the "murrrrr-der-ah" backing line is just great

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Stay (I Missed You)" - Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories
2. "Here Comes the Hotstepper" - Ini Kamoze
3. "I'll Make Love To You" - Boyz II Men
4. "The Sign" - Ace of Base
5. "On Bended Knee" - Boyz II Men
6. "The Power of Love" - Céline Dion
7. "All for Love" - Brian Adams / Rod Stewart / Sting
8. "I Swear" - All-4-One
9. "Hero" - Mariah Carey
10. "Bump n' Grind" - R. Kelly

You know what, let's just forget about how many songs reached #1 in a year from now on; I feel like it's 1958 all over again! Despite only 10 songs reaching #1 this year, I can safely say that this was a good year. Not a single bad or even "meh" song. Maybe R. Kelly's song is a little hard to listen to in retrospect, but even then his song is at least above-average in quality which I would consider "good".

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1995
----

1. "On Bended Knee" - Boyz II Men

	- First time an artist replaced itself at the top spot since The Beatles in 1964
	- A much more tamer performance this time around; unlike the massive epic songs they've had reach #1, this one's much more restrained
	- I really wish I could say something that hasn't already been said; it's just a good song in of itself
	
2. "Creep" - TLC

	- I always thought that TLC was the natural extension of the kind of Rap/R&B crossover stuff that Salt-N-Pepa originally did
	- Those drums are on-point
	- Great chorus; those vocal harmonies are out of this world
	- It's cool to see an all female vocal group singing in a lower register than most others

3. "Take a Bow" - Madonna

	- Mid-tempo pop ballad; co-written by Babyface, who also wrote most of Boyz II Men's hits
	- It definitely shows; it sounds like Madonna singing a Boyz II Men song
	- Y'know, this actually reminds me of a Carpenters song; Madonna's voice is very similar to Karen Carpenter's here
	- It's not half-bad; a very honed and well-made pop song

4. "This Is How We Do It" - Montell Jordan

	- First #1 hit song from Def Jam Records; this is from the "Golden Era" of west-coast rap
	- Jordan's voice is not only very melodic, but his flow is also on-point here
	- The "This is how we do it!" refrain during the chorus is too catchy to not sing

5. "Have You Every Really Loved a Woman?" - Bryan Adams

	- Soft rock ballad written for the film "Don Juan DeMarco"; centers around the spanish guitar
	- Besides some really good guitar work, I can't say it's anything too special

6. "Waterfalls" - TLC

	- We've finally made it to the song that was #1 the week I was born!
	- I like how "Stevie Wonder" sounding this song is; I'm sure he's proud of TLC here
	- A pretty sad song covering a whole bunch of topics; but despite all of that, the song has a sort of sober optimism to it
	- Very solid chorus; really hammers home the message of the song

7. "Kiss from a Rose" - Seal

	- Progressive soul song featured in the film "Batman Forever"
	- That vocal intro is so ethereal and wispy; I like it
	- Seal's vocal performace is top-notch here, it's very acrobatic, has a wide-range, and is very powerful
	- I really love the wide breadth of instrumentation used throughout
	- That orchestral movement during the chorus is straight-up legendary

8. "You Are Not Alone" - Michael Jackson

	- The King of Pop's final #1 hit in his lifetime; love ballad written by R. Kelly
	- As good as Jackson's vocal performance is here, this really should have just been an R. Kelly song; this really doesn't fit Jackson all that well

9. "Gangsta's Paradise" - Coolio feat. L.V.

	- Our first gangsta rap song to reach #1; the first-person ponderings of a gang leader
	- That Stevie Wonder sample really sets the spooky, desperate tone of the song so well
	- I can't help but love a good story; Coolio's lyrics are just sooo good here. Truely Shakespearian quality.
	- L.V.'s vocals during the chorus really elevate this song to a higher level
	- "Tell me why are we so blind to see, that the one's we hurt are you and me?" That is such a good lyric; absolutely amazing

10. "Fantasy" - Mariah Carey

	- Oh shit, is that "Genius of Love" by Tom-Tom Club I hear being sampled?
	- That chorus is so good; so many layers of vocals, all harmonized so well
	- Wow, Carey even sings some of the "Genius of Love" lyrics too!
	- Very impressive overall; it cool to see Carey with a good taste in '80s art rock

11. "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" - Whitney Houston

	- Houston's final #1 hit song; slow R&B song
	- Well, you can't say that Houston didn't change with the times. It basically sounds like an R. Kelly song
	- I mean hell, it was even written by Babyface!
	- Of course Houston's vocals are on-point here, but I can't say that I like the "shoop, shoop, shoop, shooby" backing vocal; kinda tacky

12. "One Sweet Day" - Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men

	- Slow R&B song about mourning the death of a loved one; implied that they were a victim of the AIDs epidemic
	- What do you get when you take the world's biggest female pop star of 1995 and have her collaborate with the world's biggest music group of 1995?
	- ...you get the longest running #1 hit song for 24 years, that's what! This song was #1 for 16 consectutive weeks, and wouldn't be surpassed until 2019. So does it stack up?
	- ...I would say yeah, it does! The song is very somber and sad, and Carey and Boyz II Men play off each other very well here; they're performances really hammer home the message of the song
	- That chorus is so angelic; very fitting that the lyrics are about meeting them again in heaven

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Gangsta's Paradise" - Coolio feat. L.V.
2. "Kiss from a Rose" - Seal
3. "One Sweet Day" - Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men

9. "You Are Not Alone" - Michael Jackson
10. "Take a Bow" - Madonna
11. "Have You Every Really Loved a Woman?" - Bryan Adams
12. "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" - Whitney Houston

This was a VERY good year! The variety was a bit lacking, but what we did get was some of the best R&B/Rap we've heard so far. You can tell that everyone that had a #1 hit this year really honed their craft to create something special.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1996
----

1. "One Sweet Day" - Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men

	- Slow R&B song about mourning the death of a loved one; implied that they were a victim of the AIDs epidemic
	- What do you get when you take the world's biggest female pop star of 1995 and have her collaborate with the world's biggest music group of 1995?
	- ...you get the longest running #1 hit song for 24 years, that's what! This song was #1 for 16 consectutive weeks, and wouldn't be surpassed until 2019. So does it stack up?
	- ...I would say yeah, it does! The song is very somber and sad, and Carey and Boyz II Men play off each other very well here; they're performances really hammer home the message of the song
	- That chorus is so angelic; very fitting that the lyrics are about meeting them again in heaven

2. "Because You Loved Me" - Céline Dion

	- Slow pop ballad
	- Eh, it's okay; Dion's vocal performance is good, but it's hardly anything to get excited about
	
3. "Always By My Baby" - Mariah Carey

	- Mid-tempo love song
	- Very happy sounding
	- Good vocal harmonies during the chorus
	- Solid song; it's good, but I liked her previous #1 hits more
	
4. "Tha Crossroads" - Bone Thugs-N-Harmony

	- I guess these guys were like the edgier version of Boyz II Men
	- Solid rap flows from all involved; not half-bad harmonies either
	- As good as the performances are, the production and mixing really make it feel tacky


5. "How Do U Want It/California Love" - 2Pac feat. K-Ci & Jojo/feat. Dr. Dre & Roger Troutman

	- Double single; 2Pac's only #1 hit just 2 months before his murder
	- "How Do U Want It"
		- That bassline under the verses and choruses is mezmerizing
		- Great chorus; solid vocal harmonies
	- "California Love"
		- That accending chromatic piano riff is straight-up badass!
		- Solid lyrics and performance by 2Pac
		- I'll be frank, I really don't think the talkbox vocals from Roger Troutman fit the song all that well

6. "You're Makin' Me High"/"Let It Flow" - Toni Braxton

	- "You're Makin' Me High"
		- Mid-tempo R&B song
		- Solid groove throughout the whole song
		- The vocal performace from Braxton fits the song so well
	- "Let It Flow"
		- Included on the soundtrack of the flim "Waiting to Exhale"
		- I really like that acoustic guitar riff with that electric guitar underneath it; really makes the song feel dreamy
		- Another good vocal performace; this time very restrained
		
7. "Macarena (Bayside Boys Mix)" - Los del Río

	- Dance-pop remix of a Latin pop song from 1993
	- Oh god, it's the Macarena. This damn song...
	- The valley girl verse sections cringy as hell and not performed well AT ALL
	- Honestly the vocals from Los del Río are really the only good part; they have a good cadence
	- The actual song underneath it is also not half-bad; but sum of it's parts do not make-up for the whole

8. "No Diggity" - Blackstreet feat. Dr. Dre & Queen Pen
	
	- Nice and minimalistic Rap/R&B song; an amazing drum beat
	- I really like that Bill Withers sample looped throughout the song; great selection
	- Dr. Dre coming out of the gate to set the tone of the song; top-notch work in the first 30 seconds
	- Great vocal performances from everyone in Blackstreet; a nice variety of vocal timbres
	- Hell, even Queen Pen's verse is pretty good!
	
9. "Un-Break My Heart" - Toni Braxton

	- Slow R&B song
	- Honestly, this one's kinda lame; it's so melodramtic and very predictable

Wow... only 9 #1 hits this year. Anyway, this one was alright; not too exciting. Very little variety and what was here wasn't anything too special. Not to say it was bad, but once again; it lacked the "oomph" previous years had.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
1997
----

1. "Un-Break My Heart" - Toni Braxton

	- Slow R&B song
	- Honestly, this one's kinda lame; it's so melodramtic and very predictable
	
2. "Wannabe" - Spice Girls

	- All-girl singer group; first and only #1 hit for Spice Girls
	- The hard cut between the verses and choruses are jarring and out of place
	- These lyrics are just so low-effort and make no sense
	- I really have no clue as to how this is considered a classic of the '90s; It's so tacky and poorly done
	- I guess the "I wanna (huh), I wanna (huh)... etc." lyric is kinda neat; has a rhythmic quality to it

3. "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" - Puff Daddy feat. Masekela
	
	- Oh hell yeah, a Grandmaster Flash sample! Nice to hear it
	- Honestly, Puff Daddy's vocal performance sounds so flat and bored. You're supposed to sound large and in-charge, man!
	- The poor vocal performance is carried into the failed attempts to sing the lyrics to the "Break My Stride" by Matthew Wilder
	- Besides the one good sample choice, It's really just not all that great

4. "Hypnotize" - The Notorious B.I.G.

	- Another posthumous #1 hit, 2 months after Biggie Smalls murder
	- Samples another #1 hit from 1979, Herp Alpert's "Rise"; mainly the guitar riff
	- Solid beat; great bassline and drums
	- Lyrical execution from Biggie Smalls is top-notch; not super aggressive, but still has a dominating presence over the song
	- Overall a pretty good song; It's always a shame when an artist's life is cut so short

5. "MMMBop" - Hanson

	- Wow, we went from Gangsta rap to upbeat "sunshine and rainbows"; this is a teeny-bopper pop-rock song
	- I like that guitar riff that plays throughout the song
	- Very upbeat and "sweet", but in a sugar-coated way
	- I will say that it's a lot better than the bubblegum pop from the '60s, but no mattter how they try and spin it, this is still bubblegum pop

6. "I'll Be Missing You" - Puff Daddy & Faith Evans feat. 112

	- Tribute song to the life of Biggie Smalls; samples #1 hit from The Police, "Every Breath You Take"
	- I can tell that this was a geniune tribute, Puff Daddy being a close musical partner to Biggie and Evans being his widow; probably making this the saddest song to ever hit #1
	- As genuine as this song is, I can't but help but feel that this is a weak performance. It really could have been soooo much better, but this one falls flat for me

7. "Mo Money Mo Problems" - The Notorious B.I.G. feat. Puff Daddy & Muse

	- Another posthumous #1 hit for Biggie Smalls, this time featuring his former musical partner Puff Daddy
	- Samples Diana Ross' "I'm Coming Out"; has a sort of funk/disco feel to it
	- Puff Daddy's performance is a little better this time, but still fairly flat overall
	- Biggie's verses are the best part; solid flow, great delivery. Really just goes to show you how much more talented he was compared to Puff Daddy

8. "Honey" - Mariah Carey

	- Carey's first #1 to be a "Hip hop" song, as opposed to the typical R&B she's used to; Cowritten by Puff Daddy
	- Another great sampling choice, this time it's "Hey DJ" by World-Famous Supreme Team, and "The Body Rock" bt the Treacherous Three
	- Can't say I like Carey's vocal performance on this one, instead of being controlled and powerful, it's instead whispy and airy; not her strong suit
	
9. "4 Seasons Of Lonelessness" - Boyz II Men

	- Final #1 hit for Boyz II Men; I guess it's fitting that it's next to a Mariah Carey song, the other big hit group of the '90s
	- Very similar vocally to "One Sweet Day" from 1995; but a lot less powerful this time
	- As good as their vocal performances are here, the song as a whole is really just putting me to sleep; a shame for them to end on such a low note

10. "Candle In The Wind 1997/Something About the Way You Look Tonight" - Elton John
	
	- "Candle In The Wind 1997"
		- A re-recording of John's 1973 hit, a tribute to the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died earlier in 1997
		- It's an okay re-recording, the '90s production sheen really takes away the simple charm of the original; I definitely perfer the original
	- "Something About the Way You Look Tonight"
		- Solid chorus; well performed
		- Everything else around the chorus is just "meh"; John is definitely well out of his prime here

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Hypnotize" - The Notorious B.I.G.
2. "Mo Money Mo Problems" - The Notorious B.I.G. feat. Puff Daddy & Muse
3. "Candle In The Wind 1997/Something About the Way You Look Tonight" - Elton John
4. "MMMBop" - Hanson
5. "Honey" - Mariah Carey
6. "I'll Be Missing You" - Puff Daddy & Faith Evans feat. 112

8. "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" - Puff Daddy feat. Masekela
9. "Un-Break My Heart" - Toni Braxton
10. "Wannabe" - Spice Girls

Not a good year AT ALL; very disappointing that Biggie Smalls was the only act that I really enjoyed this year. I just really hope that when we get to the '00s, it's not this drab and boring.

----
1998
----

1. "Candle In The Wind 1997/Something About the Way You Look Tonight" - Elton John
	
	- "Candle In The Wind 1997"
		- A re-recording of John's 1973 hit, a tribute to the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died earlier in 1997
		- It's an okay re-recording, the '90s production sheen really takes away the simple charm of the original; I definitely perfer the original
	- "Something About the Way You Look Tonight"
		- Solid chorus; well performed
		- Everything else around the chorus is just "meh"; John is definitely well out of his prime here

2. "Truly Madly Deeply" - Savage Garden

	- Mid-tempo pop duo song
	- Nice vocal cadence; very consistant
	- Not a half-bad chorus
	- I wouldn't concider it anything too special
	
3. "Together Again" - Janet Jackson

	- Dance/House song
	- Interesting harp intro; goes into the jazzy house part of the song shortly after
	- I really like that jazz chord progression; nice to see it in a pop song
	- Chorus is pretty catchy
	- Song is good, but far from legendary

4. "Nice & Slow" - Usher

	- A "Nice and slow" R&B song
	- Neat acoustic guitar under the mix
	- Usher's rapping section isn't too bad
	- Honestly, this feels like a better version of "Freak Me" by Silk, which really isn't saying much

5. "My Heart Will Go On" - Céline Dion

	- Slow pop ballad written for the film "Titanic"
	- Nice use of the tin whistle; very pleasent
	- I really like how the song builds up to that final chorus
	- Great vocal performace from Dion

6. "Gettin' Jiggy wit It" - Will Smith

	- Did you know that Will Smith started as a rapper before he got into TV and Film?
	- This time he is without his partner-in-crime, DJ Jazzy Jeff
	- Very upbeat and funky
	- Smith's flow is on-point; it may be pretty sterile and clean, but it suits his style well enough
	- Very catchy chorus with that "Na na na na na na na!" refrain

7. "All My Life" - K-Ci & Jojo

	- Slow R&B song
	- They both harmonize very well, but their voices just aren't made for smooth R&B
	- The whole mix is very basic and sterile; lacks character
	- It's not bad, but it is painfully mediocre
	
8. "Too Close" - Next

	- Funky R&B song
	- I think this was the basis for that "Why you always lyin'?" Vine meme from a few years ago
	- Solid vocal performance from all involved
	- It's really just a solid R&B song; not much to complain about

9. "My All" - Mariah Carey

	- Carey's first attempt at a Latin pop song
	- Besides Carey's great vocal performance, the song as a whole is just real boring

10. "The Boy Is Mine" - Brandy & Monica

	- A monster of an R&B Song, #1 for 13 consectutive weeks
	- The fast harp arpeggios under the song are kinda neat
	- The electric pop & slap bassline is also kinda neat
	- No clue as to why this one topped the chart for so long, it's really just an okay song

11. "I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing" - Aerosmith

	- Song written for the film "Armageddon"
	- Weird seeing an only '70s rock band getting a #1 this late in their career; this one's a symphonic power ballad
	- I really like those ominous strings in the intro; very nice
	- Steven Tyler's vocal performance is pretty good too
	- Solid chorus; very epic-sounding
	- Okay... NOW this has to be the last '80s power ballad. It only took another 8 years for the '80s to truely end!

12. "The First Night" - Monica

	- Solid Diana Ross sample under the song; ("Love Hangover")
	- I kind of like the chorus; it has a nice vocal cadence
	- I will say this one's better than "The Boy Is Mine", but it's still just "okay"
	
13. "One Week" - Barenaked Ladies

	- Pop Rock song; wow... took a while for one these to reach #1 again
	- By the way, this song was #1 for only just "one week"
	- Wow, these lyrics are hilarious, and their delivery is insanely fast
	- "Chickity China, the Chinese Chicken" is such an absurd lyric; I love it
	- I really do like that eerie chorus; really stands out from the poppy verses
	
14. "Doo Wop (That Thing)" - Lauryn Hill

	- Rap/R&B song
	- Insanely funky; very throwbacky to the Motown era
	- The instrumentation is on-point here; very tight and well-performed
	- Very solid chorus; well-done with all those backing vocals
	- Hill's flow is really good; works well with the beat

15. "Lately" - Divine

	- R&B ballad
	- Real nice arpeggiated electric-guitar chords throughout the song
	- Great vocal harmonies; it's like an all-women Boyz II Men
	- The composition is very well done; not overbearing or cheesy
	
16. "I'm Your Angel" - R. Kelly & Céline Dion

	- Interesting duet; never thought I'd see Dion sing an R. Kelly song
	- Not all that great; I guess the vocal performances are good, but the song as a whole is boring

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Doo Wop (That Thing)" - Lauryn Hill
2. "Lately" - Divine
3. "I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing" - Aerosmith
4. "Gettin' Jiggy wit It" - Will Smith

14. "My All" - Mariah Carey
15. "I'm Your Angel" - R. Kelly & Céline Dion
16. "All My Life" - K-Ci & Jojo
	
We did it! We've manage to have a year beat out 1978 for "Most Meh Year"! Not a single song from this year is featured on my best or worst #1 hits of all-time lists. Man, it's a shame that this year wasn't all that much better than last year. I really hope that the final year of the '90s is good, I'd hate to end on such a low-note.
	
----------------------------------------------------------	

----
1999
----

1. "I'm Your Angel" - R. Kelly & Céline Dion

	- Interesting duet; never thought I'd see Dion sing an R. Kelly song
	- Not all that great; I guess the vocal performances are good, but the song as a whole is boring
	
2. "Have You Ever?" - Brandy

	- Starts off strong with some angelic vocal harmonies
	- Great production; very smooth-sounding and easy to listen to
	- Just a solid slow R&B song overall
	
3. "...Baby One More Time" - Britney Spears

	- Teeny bopper song; Probably the single most "1999" sounding song ever
	- Has a nice groove to it; can't say that I like her voice here all that much
	- It's not a half-bad song; but it's really nothing too speical
	
4. "Angel of Mine" - Monica

	- Acoustic guitar driven slow R&B song
	- I actually think the guitar matches the hip hop beat pretty well
	- I really like that chorus; especially the "angel of mine" line

5. "Believe" - Cher

	- It's been a while since Cher had a #1 hit, I think the last one was "Dark Lady" in 1974, making this the widest gap between #1 hits for an artist so far
	- This is also the oldest solo female to hit #1, Cher being 52-years-old at the time
	- Suprisingly, it's a dance-pop song with heavy use of autotune; I think this is one of first times it was used in pop music
	- Cher's still got her voice after all these years; impressive
	- It's very upbeat and I actually think the autotune is nice production choice, but I can't imagine listening to this outside of a dance club

6. "No Scrubs" - TLC

	- Absolutely hilarious lyrics; these chicks really don't like scrubs, do they?
	- Solid beat; a real head bopper
	- Pleasant guitar chords throughout; really like those jazz chords!
	- Great chorus; really hammers the point home
	- I will say, if this song was released in our post-2008 recession world, TLC would have a hard time being taken seriously. Good luck trying to find a guy who DOESN'T still live at home with their parents. Housing is fuckin' expensive these days! Maybe in 1999, every one was still living in that "post-cold war afterglow", but, oh boy, how just a few years can change everything...

7. "Livin' la Vida Loca" - Ricky Martin

	- Upbeat latin pop song
	- I really can't say I like Martin's voice during the verses; it's just so plain and unenthusiastic
	- It's nice to see an upbeat song this year, but the whole latin sound here really just comes off as a tacky novelty

8. "If You Had My Love" - Jennifer Lopez

	- Nice use of harpsichord and strings on this one
	- The chorus is nice to listen to
	- Either than that, it's a pretty stock-sounding pop song

9. "Bills, Bills, Bills" - Destiny's Child

	- Wow, two #1 hit songs in a row that have a harpsichord? Amazing!
	- The song has this snappy, jerky feel to it; I actually like it
	- The vocal cadence of the vocalists are really on-point here
	- A unique song that has a feel I haven't seen so far
	
10. "Wild Wild West" - Will Smith feat. Dru Hill & Kool Moe Dee

	- Written for the Will Smith film of the same name; samples former #1 hit song "I Wish" by Stevie Wonder
	- Was award a Raspberry Award for "Worst Original Song" for a film
	- Whether or not I like this song or not, it's knocked up several pegs for simply sampling one of my favorite Stevie Wonder songs
	- I'm gonna go against popular opinion is saying that Will Smith's clean rap is good, actually; This guy really knows how to write a clean song that's still true to the edge of hip hop

11. "Genie In a Bottle" - Christina Aguilera

	- Another teeny bopper song this year
	- This one's a lot better than Spear's song I think; much more solid
	- Has an ethereal quality to it, which is suprising for the kind of sing it is
	- One negative I think is the kick drum; it's a little too loud and is way to erratic
	
12. "Baliamos" - Enrique Iglesias

	- Another latin pop song; However I think this one feels a lot more authentic compared to Ricky Martin's "Livin' la Vida Loca"
	- I really like that chorus; very powerful and catchy
	- Solid flamenco guitar in the song; I love it
	
13. "Unpretty" - TLC

	- Acoustic and electric guitar driven R&B song
	- Has a suprisingly happy chord-progression
	- Great vocal performance from TLC on the chorus
	- It's nice to see TLC trying a "rock" song, but this really just feels like a royalty-free "rock" song used for public television

14. "Heartbreaker" - Mariah Carey feat. Jay-Z

	- Here's Carey pushing further into hip-hop with this one
	- I really don't think Carey and Jay-Z fit together well here. It just feels like a Mariah Carey song with some out-of-place Jay-Z raps over it
	- Even with the "Attack of the Name Game" by Stacy Lattisaw sample accounted for, the production quality on the song sounds like it was released in 1990, not 1999!
	- The Jay-Z rap verse is done well, but is once again out-of-place for a song like this

15. "Smooth" - Santana feat. Rob Thomas

	- Our final #1 hit of the millennium and the 20th century... and it's another latin pop song! Ahhhhh!
	- Well, it is a Santana song, and he's one hell of a guitar player, so let's check it out.
	- The lead vocals by Rob Thomas (or Matchbox Twenty fame) aren't half-bad; and neither is Santana's guitar ad-lib throughout the song!
	- That chorus is really good; solid composition
	- Once again, I'd like to point out Santana's face-melting guitar work on this one. It's soooo good!

OVERALL RANKING

1. "No Scrubs" - TLC
2. "Smooth" - Santana feat. Rob Thomas
3. "Wild Wild West" - Will Smith feat. Dru Hill & Kool Moe Dee

13. "Livin' la Vida Loca" - Ricky Martin
14. "Heartbreaker" - Mariah Carey feat. Jay-Z
15. "I'm Your Angel" - R. Kelly & Céline Dion

Not a half-bad year, honestly. It could have been stronger, but there were some good one's this year. Well, that's the '90s and the entire 20th century of #1 hits. In just another 20 years, and we'll be up to our current year! I'm optimistic to see what the 21st century has to offer. It's around this time that I can start to recollect memories of what was on the radio and TV. I never really got into "my generation's" music; I was too busy listening to The Beatles, Johnny Cash, David Bowie, and Metallica to care about what was going on, so a lot of this will be probably be new to me, unless I recognize it from a school function I was at in 5th grade or from an obscure TV commercial. I guess now, I'll start getting "nostalgic" of the music I never really bother to listen to but nevertheless remember from my early youth. Let's go!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2000
----

1. "Smooth" - Santana feat. Rob Thomas

	- Our final #1 hit of the millennium and the 20th century... and it's another latin pop song! Ahhhhh!
	- Well, it is a Santana song, and he's one hell of a guitar player, so let's check it out.
	- The lead vocals by Rob Thomas (or Matchbox Twenty fame) aren't half-bad; and neither is Santana's guitar ad-lib throughout the song!
	- That chorus is really good; solid composition
	- Once again, I'd like to point out Santana's face-melting guitar work on this one. It's soooo good!

2. "What a Girl Wants" - Christina Aguilera

	- I kinda like the erratic rhythm of the song
	- Has nice jazzy chorus; very cool
	- It not a half-bad song, but it's not something I'd write home about
	
3. "I Knew I Loved You" - Savage Garden

	- Slow pop ballad
	- I like the rising arpeggiated guitar chords; very pleasant to listen to
	- Solid performance; however, it's nothing too special of a song
	
4. "Thank God I Found You" - Mariah Carey feat. Joe & 98 Degrees

	- Slow R&B song
	- It sounds like a mixed of the last two #1 hits; very weird coincidence
	- Joe & 98 Degrees' performance is pretty solid
	- Another song that's not half-bad, but nothing too special
	
5. "Amazed (AC Mix)" - Lonestar

	- Country power ballad
	- It really does just feel like a knock-off of "I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing" by Aerosmith
	- Besides that, it's a fairly decent song; it's done well-enough

6. "Say My Name" - Destiny's Child

	- They have an insane flow on this one; they should be a rap group instead!
	- Besides the good vocal performances, the song really just sounds like a second-rate TLC song
	
7. "Maria Maria" - Santana feat. The Product G&B

	- It sounds like a fusion of Dr. Dre and Santana; interesting creative choice
	- Very tasty guitar licks throughout
	- The vocals from The Product R&B are pretty solid; still a little out of place for a Santana song

8. "Try Again" - Aaliyah

	- Dance-pop/R&B song
	- Those acid synths don't sound half-bad
	- It kind of drags on a bit, but the song as a whole is pretty solid
	
9. "Be With You" - Enrique Iglesias

	- Dance-pop song
	- Kind of feels like "Believe" by Cher; however this one's a bit more restrained in it's performance
	- Another good song that I really wouldn't listen to outside of a club setting

10. "Everything You Want" - Vertical Horizon

	- Our first post-grunge rock song to reach #1; it really took nearly a whole decade for this genre to get to the top, huh?
	- I really like that fade-in and out pedal effect on the main guitar riff
	- Surprisingly upbeat and happy-sounding concidering the genre it's from
	- Solid bridge section; sounds kinda heavy
	- You know, a lot of people look back at the early '00s rock in digust, but honestly, this sound was probably the closest rock was ever going to get to mainstream pop appeal, and it really isn't half-bad. I like it!
	
11. "Bent" - Matchbox Twenty

	- Post-grunge rock ballad
	- Honestly, this song just sounds like a shitty '80s rock knock-off; the only thing that's contemporary sounding here is the occational distorted metal guitar bits
	- I guess the guitar solo is kinda neat...

12. "It's Gonna Be Me" - 'N Sync

	- Boy band pop song; this one's got a real young Justin Timberlake in it!
	- Oh god, I remember how overplayed this band was. Everyone in my Kindergarden and 1st Grade class were OBSESSED with these guys
	- This song is like the boy-band equivalant of "...Baby One More Time" by Britney Spears
	- The "It's gonna be maaayyyyy" is the perfect thing to play on April 31st of every year
	
13. "Incomplete" - Sisqó

	- Smooth R&B song
	- Bah, largely forgettable song; indistinguishable from most other slow R&B we've heard but even more generic-sounding

14. "Doesn't Really Matter" - Janet Jackson

	- R&B song featured in the film "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps"
	- Wow... that's an odd choice for a flim for a song like this one
	- Damn, this one sounds like an obnoxious version of a Destiny's Child song; those weird sounds effects throughout the song are really distracting
	- Waayyyyy too long; why is this song 5 minutes long?!

15. "Music" - Madonna

	- This one's a weird departure for Madonna; it's like an electronic funk song with robo-backing vocals
	- This one's complete garbage; the lyrics are lame, the production quality is so dry and sterile, Madonna's vocal performance is so phoned-in. It's like a parody of what a bad Madonna song would sound like, but instead it's just Madonna doing a bad song

16. "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" - Christina Aguilera

	- Solid piano chord progression and beat underneath the song
	- Man, Aguilera really likes those harpsichords, doesn't she?
	- Very upbeat and catchy; especially that chorus
	- Her best #1 hit so far, I think
	
17. "With Arms Wide Open" - Creed

	- Our third post-grunge rock #1 hit this year
	- Wow, Scott Stapp's vocal impression of Eddie Veder is so obvious, it's hard to ignore
	- The song drags on for nearly two minutes before the distored guitar come in, kinda wish they did that sooner
	- I kinda like the guitar solo,; for the most part, it fits the song well enough
	- This song could have been so much better, but it lacks the punch a song like this one should have; it's sooo softball here

18. "Independent Women Pt. 1" - Destiny's Child

	- R&B Song featured in the "Charlie's Angels" movie re-boot
	- I like this one, there's a real "attitude" present in their performances, and they are large and in-charge here
	- Great chorus; very catchy and well-done
	- The church choir section is great; good creative decision

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Everything You Want" - Vertical Horizon
2. "Smooth" - Santana feat. Rob Thomas

15. "Bent" - Matchbox Twenty
16. "Incomplete" - Sisqó
17. "Doesn't Really Matter" - Janet Jackson
18. "Music" - Madonna

Not a strong start for the new millennium. It is cool to see rock making a comeback, but I feel like the better rock songs of this era were the ones that DIDN'T reach #1. Another thing I really don't like is the directiopn R&B is going. The smooth and buttery R&B of the '90s is now morphing into this sort of mid-tempo dance sub-genre and I really don't think it's the right direction. I can only how that the variety of these songs can break the monotany in the coming years.

2001

1. "Independent Women Pt. 1" - Destiny's Child

	- R&B Song featured in the "Charlie's Angels" movie re-boot
	- I like this one, there's a real "attitude" present in their performances, and they are large and in-charge here
	- Great chorus; very catchy and well-done
	- The church choir section is great; good creative decision

2. "It Wasn't Me" - Shaggy feat. Ricardo 'Rikrok' Ducent

	- Reggae song about infidelity
	- Solid groove; I especially love the use of the 12-string acoustic guitar!
	- Shaggy's patois flow is on-point here, and Rikrok's voice is really good here
	- The lyrics are absolutely hilarious; it's clearly tongue-in-cheek

3. "Ms. Jackson" - Outkast

	- Alternative hip hop song
	- I really love that reversed beat; very unique
	- Very catchy chorus; "oooooh! I am for real!"
	- The "forever... forever? forever ever?!" line is so great
	- The flows are pretty good; it's kind of staggered, but it works well here

4. "Stutter (Double Take Remix)" - Joe feat. Mystikal

	- R&B song remix featured in the film "Double Take"
	- The performace is pretty solid here, I'm partial against the "stuttering" gimmick however
	- The Mystikal verse is probably the single most aggressive vocal performance I've heard so far; I like it!
	- I wish I could like it more, but it is kinda just "okay" overall

5. "Butterfly" - Crazy Town

	- Rap song... or is this a nu-metal song? It samples a Red Hot Chili Peppers song, so I guess it's rock technically
	- Solid flows and fairly catchy, but the lyrics are low-effort I think
	- The vocal performance is alright; it's really missing the power a song like this should have
	
6. "Angel" - Shaggy feat. Rayvon

	- Reggae song; samples the former #1 "The Joker" by Steve Miller Band and borrows the chorus from the Chip Taylor-written song "Angel In The Morning"
	- Once again, a good blend of smooth R&B vocals from the feature, and good patois rap verses by Shaggy

7. "All For You" - Janet Jackson

	- Dance-pop song; samples the main riff from "The Glow of Love" by Change
	- It's well-performed and produced, but the song is largely forgettable; it really just ticks the boxes of the genre, and nothing else

8. "Lady Marmalade" - Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mýa & Pink

	- Cover of the former #1 hit; originally performed by Labelle. This one was recorded for the soundtrack for the film "Moulin Rouge"
	- It's a faithful cover for the most part, but it's really nothing special. Besides the rap verse from Lil' Kim, it lacks any real creative direction

9. "U Remind Me" - Usher

	- Smooth mid-tempo R&B song
	- Very solid vocal performace from Usher; especially during that chorus
	- It's not a half-bad song, but it's really nothing too special
	
10. "Bootylicious" - Destiny's Child

	- Oh shit, this song samples the main guitar riff from "Edge of Seventeen" by Stevie Nicks!
	- Great vocal cadence from all involved
	- Good chorus; very catchy
	- As great as the sample is, it just drones on for the whole song; no really creative use of it honestly

11. "Fallin'" - Alica Keys

	- Neo-soul song; very piano-driven song with a minimalistic beat
	- Great vocal performace by Keys, suits the song very well
	- Haunting vocal harmonies towards the end; very cool
	- Very faithful to '60s soul music; very qualified to carry the torch
	
12. "I'm Real (Murder Mix)" - Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule

	- Hip hop song; was #1 during the 9/11 attacks, kinda eerie that the "murder" mix was what went #1
	- Ja Rule really steals the show here; his voice carries the song, and makes Lopez's vocals feel like backing vocals
	- Solid beat behind the song; a head-bopper for sure
	- Great chorus; very catchy
	
13. "Family Affair" - Mary J. Blige

	- Solid production by Dr. Dre here; hell, even the beat sounds like it would be a Dr. Dre song
	- Great vocal performace by Blige, here flows are good and here voice sounds real good here
	- Very catchy chorus
	- If it wasn't for Blige's performance, it would be a fairly standard R&B song
	
14. "U Got It Bad" - Usher

	- Slow R&B song; acoustic guitar driven
	- I guess someone had to carry the torch of slow R&B after Boyz II Men left the scene; can't say I enjoy this too much but it's well-done for what it's worth
	- Neat guitar solo outro though
	
15. "How You Remind Me" - Nickelback

	- This was probably the last straight-up rock song to reach #1, and it's no surprise to me that it's a Nickelback song
	- My first real clear memory of a song at 6-years-old; I remember how one week, this song didn't exist, and then the next week it was EVERYWHERE. On the radio, on burnt-CDs, at grocery stores, it was insane how this one blew up and according to Neilsen Soundscan, this was the #1 song of the decade in terms radioplay for the '00s decade
	- Solid guitar driven song; a lot more distortion focused and it's in Drop D tuning!
	- The vocals are decent; can't say I like Chad Kroger's voice, but it fits the style well enough
	- The chorus is good; and I like the quiet middle-section as well

1. "Ms. Jackson" - Outkast
2. "It Wasn't Me" - Shaggy feat. Ricardo 'Rikrok' Ducent
3. "Fallin'" - Alica Keys
4. "How You Remind Me" - Nickelback
5. "I'm Real (Murder Mix)" - Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule
6. "Angel" - Shaggy feat. Rayvon
7. "Family Affair" - Mary J. Blige
8. "Independent Women Pt. 1" - Destiny's Child
9. "Stutter (Double Take Remix)" - Joe feat. Mystikal
10. "Lady Marmalade" - Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mýa & Pink
11. "U Remind Me" - Usher
12. "U Got It Bad" - Usher
13. "Bootylicious" - Destiny's Child
14. "All For You" - Janet Jackson
15. "Butterfly" - Crazy Town

Not a bad year, in fact a good one! The '00s sound is a lot more honed now, and even the boring songs or songs with problems have a special charm to them. I'm also starting to get some memories of these songs back when they were new. I think that will probably start paint my opinion about them, as now I have the historical context behind these songs to concider. I may or may not like these upcoming songs, but I'll feel a little more in-tune with them now that it's stuff I can remember.

1. "How You Remind Me" - Nickelback

	- This was probably the last straight-up rock song to reach #1, and it's no surprise to me that it's a Nickelback song
	- My first real clear memory of a song at 6-years-old; I remember how one week, this song didn't exist, and then the next week it was EVERYWHERE.

	- The vocals are decent; can't say I like Chad Kroger's voice, but it fits the style well enough
	- The chorus is good; and I like the quiet middle-section as well
	
2. "U Got It Bad" - Usher

	- Slow R&B song; acoustic guitar driven
	- I guess someone had to carry the torch of slow R&B after Boyz II Men left the scene; can't say I enjoy this too much but it's well-done for what it's worth
	- Neat guitar solo outro though
	
3. "Always on Time" - Ja Rule feat. Ashanti

	- R&B/Hip-hop song
	- Besides the solid guitar-driven beat, Ja Rule's performance sounds "fake" aggressive here; sounds like he's trying to be tough
	- Ashanti's performace is good enough, but it's really nothing too speical; it could have been anybody honestly

4. "Ain't It Funny (Murder Mix)" - Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule

	- It's... like... literally the same song as the last one. Well, it's actually extremely similar
	- If anything, both performaces are a bit better here, but overall the song isn't anything too special

5. "Foolish" - Ashanti

	- It feels likes slow R&B song, but sounds like a mid-tempo R&B song; weird how that turned out
	- Honestly, the production is really tacky; I really think the person who composed the beat should have put more work into it
	- Way too repetitive; the 5-second loop of the beat is what does that
	
6. "Hot In Herre" - Nelly

	- Gotta throw in an extra "r" in "Here", 'cause why not?!
	- Very upbeat R&B song; has a nice driving force behind it
	- Nelly's performance is on-point, he's in-charge on this track
	- The chorus is little silly, but much like "Baby Got Back" by Sir Mix-a-Lot, Nelly's command presence of the song makes up for it

7. "Dilemma" - Nelly feat. Kelly Rowland

	- Two #1 hits in a rwo for Nelly, good for him
	- This honestly just feels like a better-produced version of "Tha Crossroads" by Bone Thugs-N-Harmony; I like it
	- Howland's performace on the chorus is good for the most part but like the other songs this year, this feature could have been anybody else and nobody would have noticed

8. "A Moment Like This" - Kelly Clarkson

	- First #1 hit from an "American Idol" contestant; the staple vocal talent show of the '00s decade
	- Clarkson's voice sounds good on this song, but it's just... so... boring! They really phoned this one in to capitalize on the topicalness of Clarkson, didn't they?

9. "Lose Yourself" - Eminem

	- Song written for the semi-autobiographical film "8-Mile", starring Eminem
	- I really like that somber piano intro before leading into that filthy guitar riff; amazing composition!
	- M O M ' S  S P A G H E T T I
	- Fantastic verses from Eminem; sold flow and has some interesting and unique rhythms
	- Great chorus; very singable and epic-sounding

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Lose Yourself" - Eminem
2. "Hot In Herre" - Nelly
3. "How You Remind Me" - Nickelback
4. "Dilemma" - Nelly feat. Kelly Rowland
5. "Ain't It Funny (Murder Mix)" - Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule
6. "Always on Time" - Ja Rule feat. Ashanti
7. "U Got It Bad" - Usher
8. "Foolish" - Ashanti
9. "A Moment Like This" - Kelly Clarkson

A very "meh" year; It's insane how long America kept the most mundane songs at the top of the charts for so long; only 9 #1 hits songs happened this year, with only 7 being new songs! However, they're not terrible, but most of these songs lack the character I crave for. I really do hope next year is better.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2003
----

1. "Lose Yourself" - Eminem

	- Song written for the semi-autobiographical film "8-Mile", starring Eminem
	- I really like that somber piano intro before leading into that filthy guitar riff; amazing composition!
	- M O M ' S  S P A G H E T T I
	- Fantastic verses from Eminem; sold flow and has some interesting and unique rhythms
	- Great chorus; very singable and epic-sounding
	
2. "Bump, Bump, Bump" - B2K feat. P. Diddy

	- R&B Singer group song with a hip hop edge
	- I like the classical guitar beat; sounds well done
	- The singers do pretty well here, even P Diddy's verse is solid, but it's not enough to make up for the "meh" quality of the song as a whole
	
3. "All I Have" - Jennifer Lopez feat. LL Cool J

	- Smooth R&B song; samples "Very Special" by Debra Laws
	- Insane how LL Cool J had his own Top 10 hit songs in the '80s and '90s, but it wasn't until 2003 when he got his first #1, and it was as a feature!
	- This one feels kinda like a girl version of "Dilemma" by Nelly; it's definitely different, but it FEELS very similar
	- This is Lopez's best vocal performace so far; solid control and not overdone
	- LL Cool J's verses are also pretty solid too, but the lyrical content leaves me wanting something a bit deeper

4. "In Da Club" - 50 Cent

	- Like how "Fortunate Son" by CCR was the soundtrack to Vietnam War, this was the soundtrack to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq; gangsta rap song
	- The "it's your birthday!" line sounds a little silly, but 50 Cent really pulls it off
	- That beat is so badass; it's like he was going for an "epic" rap song
	- 50 Cent's rap flows are on-point, especially during that chorus
	
5. "Get Busy" - Sean Paul

	- Our first proper Dancehall song to hit #1
	- It's like a faster version of "Clint Eastwood" by Gorillaz, but with a jamaican patois
	- Song somehow manages to feel like it's goes by too fast while also feeling like it goes on forever; impressive feat, but not the good kind

6. "21 Questions" - 50 Cent feat. Nate Dogg

	- The smoother side of 50 Cent; this one's a bit more restrained than "In Da Club"
	- I can't say I like the clean electric guitar beat; it's way too stuttery and repetitive
	- The "I love you like how a fat kid loves cake" line really wasn't thought through, was it?
	- This one really show how 50 Cent is much better at the "large-and-in-charge" rap style
	
7. "This is The Night" - Clay Aiken

	- Another "American Idol" contestant #1 hit song; mid-tempo pop ballad
	- Aiken's voice is really good on this one, but just like the Kelly Clarkson song from last year, it's just a real boring song overall

8. "Crazy In Love" - Beyoncé feat. Jay-Z

	- Former Destiny's Child singer's first #1 hit song; duet with her-then boyfriend
	- Solid horn section beat during the chorus; great choice of sampling
	- Great chorus hook; also that post-chorus "uh uh oh, uh uh oh..." is very catchy
	- Jay-Z's rap verse is pretty solid also!
	- Honestly, the best Destiny's Child related song so far
	
9. "Shake Ya Tailfeather" - Nelly, P. Diddy & Murphy Lee

	- Besides the cheesy police sirens, the beat is very solid
	- Nelly verse is really great; he really puts 110% into it
	- Very catchy chorus
	- It's clear that this one was tongue-in-cheek, so I can enjoy more than if it was a silly novelty song

10. "Baby Boy" - Beyoncé feat. Sean Paul

	- This one's got an Eastern/Turkish feel to it; dancehall R&B song
	- It's like a mash up of "In Da Club", "Get Busy", "Crazy In Love" from earlier in the year; weird how that turned out
	- I think both Beyoncé and Sean Paul's performaces are better than their hits from earlier in the year

11. "Stand Up" - Ludacris feat. Shawnna

	- Forget what I've said before... THIS is the most aggressive "in-your-face" hip hop so far!
	- Ludacris really doesn't give a damn, he just goes so hard on this one
	- It's a good song, but it does kind of drags on, I really wish they spiced it up with a bridge or something

12. "Hey Ya!" - Outkast

	- Acoustic guitar driven hip hop song; sung entirely by André 3000
	- I really like the chord progression; it's all major chords which is a little different, concidering how you usually have at least 1 minor chord when you do the "4-chords"
	- Very solid verses from André 3000; he really brings it
	- For such an upbeat song, it's got some pretty sad lyrics
	- The mid-section is so much fun to listen to "What's cooler than being cool? ICE COLD! Alrightalrightalright..."
	- The breakdown is also really damn good too; "Shake it like a Polaroid picture!"

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Hey Ya!" - Outkast
2. "Lose Yourself" - Eminem
3. "In Da Club" - 50 Cent
4. "Shake Ya Tailfeather" - Nelly, P. Diddy & Murphy Lee

10. "Get Busy" - Sean Paul
11. "This is The Night" - Clay Aiken
12. "21 Questions" - 50 Cent feat. Nate Dogg

Good year! Much more exciting than last, and the compostion is getting better again; it just goes to show you that there really isn't an era for when pop music was "good; a lot of the same proclivities and things we like about these songs is pretty timeless and universal across all generations.

2004

1. "Hey Ya!" - Outkast

	- Acoustic guitar driven hip hop song; sung entirelly by André 3000
	- I really like the chord progression; it's all major chords which is a little different, concidering how you usually have at least 1 minor chord when you do the "4-chords"

	- The breakdown is also really damn good too; "Shake it like a Polaroid picture!"
	
2. "The Way You Move" - Outkast feat. Sleepy Brown

	- Another Outkast #1 hit; this time sung by Big Boi
	- Great use of the 808 drum machine here; very catchy rhythm
	- Real nice smooth chorus; solid vocal harmonies
	- Besides the cheesy lyrics and repetitiveness, it's a fairly solid song
	
3. "Slow Jamz" - Twista feat. Kanye West & Jamie Foxx

	- A smooth R&B/Hip-hop song that sends a salute to the "slow jams" of years of old; samples "A House Is Not A Home" performed by Luther Vandross
	- Twista's verses are so lame and cheesy; West's and Foxx's are fairly decent and have good flow
	- I really wouldn't say this is a good song; very rushed and not well-thought out
	
4. "Yeah!" - Usher feat. Lil' Jon & Ludacris
	
	- Oh god... this is it. Our first "Crunk" #1 hit song, my least favorite sub-genre of all-time. However, let's put that aside and judge the song on it's own qualities
	- Well, I'm actually impressed by Usher on this one; his voice suits the song well
	- Can't say I like Lil' Jon on this one; his ad-libs are distracting and forced as hell
	- I guess the acid synth lines are kinda good; catchy enough
	- Ludacris' parts are fairly solid; but the "booty" outro is cheesy as hell
	
5. "Burn" - Usher

	- Mid-tempo R&B ballad
	- Usher's vocal performace is fairly solid; besides that, this song is largely forgettable

6. "I Believe" - Fantasia

	- Gospel piano ballad; sung by another "American Idol" contestant
	- Wow, this is really out of place in 2004; it sounds like it belongs in 1994 instead!
	- Although it's neat and refreshing to hear a song that isn't '00s R&B, this song isn't really anything too special

7. "Confessions Pt. II" - Usher

	- Smooth R&B song
	- I do think this is Usher's best performance so far, It still pretty indistinguishable from his other songs

8. "Slow Motion" - Juvenile feat. Soulja Slim

	- Another posthumous hit; went to #1 about a year after Slim's murder
	- Bah, a real lame attempt at trying to sound cool and tough in a rap song
	- ...Man, I hate to speak ill of the dead, but Slim's verses are really cheesy and "juvenile" Ha!
	- Very repetitive as well
	
9. "Lean Back" - Terror Squad

	- Oh shit, I remember this song from the game soundtrack for Need For Speed: Underground 2!
	- Solid beat; feels very weighty
	- Very catchy chorus
	- Solid flows from all involved, but It just feels like the song as a whole is missing that "oompf"

10. "Goodies" - Ciara feat. Petey Pablo

	- Oh god, that whistling drill synth in the back is soooo damn distracting; it's like a dogwhistle being blown throughout the song
	- Besides Pablo's decent verses, Ciara really doesn't have the voice to be a singer; you can tell she's struggling to hit... ANY notes on this song
	- It is kinda catchy; but that can't make up for the thrown-together, phoned-in, low-effort production job on this one. They really should have re-done everyone's takes and make a better beat

11. "My Boo" - Usher feat. Alica Keys

	- Another mid-tempo R&B song by Usher
	- It's got a neat sample; I can't figure out where it's from, but it sounds like the mice from the film "Babe" xD
	- I would just write this one off as another dawdling song from Usher, but Key's performance is pretty good on this one, and it really elevates the song as a whole	

12. "Drop It Like It's Hot" - Snoop Dogg feat. Pharrell Williams

	- Fairly minimal hip-hop song; It really took a whole decade for Snoop Dogg to get a #1, didn't it?
	- I will say, that "tongue knocking" sound is a little silly; but I guess it's "tongue-in-cheek"! Hahaha!
	- The chorus is pretty catchy, and the snappy synths are a nice touch
	- Snoop Dogg really owns this track; his verses are on-point, but I can't say the same for Williams. He really just sounds way to straight-edge on this one
	- Besides all of that, I still think the song as a whole is much better than the sum of it's parts

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Hey Ya!" - Outkast
2. "Drop It Like It's Hot" - Snoop Dogg feat. Pharrell Williams
3. "The Way You Move" - Outkast feat. Sleepy Brown

10. "Slow Jamz" - Twista feat. Kanye West & Jamie Foxx
11. "Slow Motion" - Juvenile feat. Soulja Slim
12. "Goodies" - Ciara feat. Petey Pablo

Pretty garbage year; completely dominated by Usher, and his "smooth" style of R&B just doesn't do it for me, Jack. Also, there were some other songs that I think were just straight duds. It was so bad that my favorite song from 2003, "Hey Ya!" was also my favorite song from this year; Not a good sign. Oh man, and we haven't even really gotten to the "Crunk" era yet, so I can only imagine how much worse it can get.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2005
----

1. "Let Me Love You" - Mario

	- Smooth R&B song
	- I like the bridge section; the chord changes are very ethereal and kinda spooky
	- I will say, this is at least one notch better than most of Usher's stuff
	
2. "Candy Shop" - 50 Cent feat. Olivia

	- Very similar to last year's "Lean Back" by Terror Squad
	- Explicitly sexual lyrics; I would like the song if it went harder, but 50 Cent and Olivia both sound so bored on this one
	
3. "Hollaback Girl" - Gwen Stefani

	- Gwen Stefani of '90s pop-punk band No Doubt, turned white girl rapping
	- I can't lie; it is a catchy song but my God, it's so cringy... We truely live in an alternate reality, elsewise this would have not transpired.
	- I also gotta admit that "This shit is Bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!" is a pretty funny line
	- I really wish I could write this song off as a "tongue-in-cheek", "all-for-fun-don't-take-it-seriously" song, but Stefani's attempt at trying to sound cool and edgy on a song this silly is what pushes it overboard for me
	
4. "We Belong Together" - Mariah Carey

	- Carey's comeback single; was #1 for 14 non-consectutive weeks and the longest running #1 of the '00s decade... is a worty comeback?
	- Well, I will say that this is a lot more compelling than most of the '00s R&B we've heard so far
	- Another great vocal performance from Carey; especially towards the end of the song
	- A good song, but I don't really think it's "legendary" as it may seem
	
5. "Inside Your Heaven" - Carrie Underwood

	- Our first country #1 hit song in a while; a bit of a slow ballad
	- This one actually reminds me of "I Don'y Wanna Miss A Thing" by Aerosmith; it sounds a bit different, but it "feels" the same
	- Great vocal performace by Underwood here; really carries the song 
	- Solid ballad; better than most we've heard so far this decade
	
6. "Gold Digger" - Kayne West feat. Jamie Foxx

	- Hip hop song; samples the Ray Charles song "I Got a Woman"
	- Solid flows by West, also great lyrics; kinda silly, but fits the theme of the song well
	- Not much else to say; it's a pretty good song
	
7. "Run It!" - Chris Brown feat. Juelz Santana

	- First #1 hit by Chris Brown; released when he was only 16-years-old
	- Chris Brown beats women
	- This song sounds very similar to "Yeah!" by Usher; just a little bit more restrained
	- I guess the chorus is kinda catchy
	- Santana's verse is actually pretty solid
	
8. "Don't Forget About Us" - Mariah Carey

	- Oh no, Mariah don't!
	- Dang, she fell for the "slow boring '00s R&B sound"...
	- Well, I guess I can't say that the song's bad since it's Carey singing; her voice tends to salt the song to palatable status
	- Eh, I guess it's okay enough

6. "Run It!" - Chris Brown feat. Juelz Santana
7. "Candy Shop" - 50 Cent feat. Olivia
8. "Hollaback Girl" - Gwen Stefani

Another plain, boring year. That might be because there was only 8 SONGS THAT WENT TO #1 THIS YEAR. That ties with 1958, and that was the year the Billboard Hot 100 was created and that started in August of that year! I mean that doesn't mean that the year is bad by default, but the songs that did top the chart really weren't all that great. If only there was more to judge this year by, I'd maybe like it but unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Let's hope that next year is better.

1. "Don't Forget About Us" - Mariah Carey

	- Oh no, Mariah don't!
	- Dang, she fell for the "slow boring '00s R&B sound"...
	- Well, I guess I can't say that the song's bad since it's Carey singing; her voice tends to salt the song to palatable status
	- Eh, I guess it's okay enough
	
2. "Laffy Taffy" - D4L

	- Crunk song; actually it's a sub-genre of Crunk called "Snap" I guess it's a more minimal and stripped down version of Crunk
	- Jesus christ, the beat and vocal performances are so obnoxious. Something tells me that these guys took this one completely seriously and didn't think to re-do this one
	- That chorus is so cheesy; it's like they were like "we need a phrase that means 'ass', what sounds good? Wait, I know! How 'bout Laffy Taffy?!"
	- Garbage lyrics; not funny or clever at all
	
3. "Grillz" - Nelly feat. Paul Wall, Ali & Gipp

	- Solid beat; very commanding
	- The flows from everyone are also pretty solid; on-point and suit the song well
	- The lyrics are a little silly, but it really doesn't take away from the song all that much
	- Besides the cheesy chorus, it's a decent song
	
4. "Check on It" - Beyoncé feat. Bun B & Slim Thug

	- The woodwind drone in the background is kind of annoying; it really drags the song out
	- Surprisingly good vocal performace by Beyoncé, and the two feature's rap flows are also pretty decent too
	- Meh, it's an alright song overall
	
5. "You're Beautiful" - James Blunt

	- Wow, a folky pop rock song; that's refreshing... and it's also a "4-Chords" song!
	- The composition is pretty good; nice and bright-sounding
	- Blunt's vocal performance is alright; some funny lyrical choices, but that's fine
	- It's a good song, but it's nothing too special
	
6. "So Sick" - Ne-Yo

	- Usher copy-cat song
	- I guess it's a bit better than your typical Usher; Ne-Yo's voice is a lot better
	- It's really nothing special, but I guess it's pleasant to listen to
	
7. "Temperature" - Sean Paul

	- Upbeat dancehall song
	- Much better than Paul's last #1 hits; much better composed and performed
	- Catchy chorus
	- I really can't picture this outside of a danceclub; it drags on for too long and there's not a whole lot to this song
	
8. "Bad Day" - Daniel Powter

	- Mid-tempo piano pop ballad
	- Great composition; especially that piano
	- Powter's voice is also on-point here; solid chops
	- Very catchy chorus; signable
	- Not a half-bad bridge section; It's refreshing to hear a decent key-change for once
	
9. "SOS" - Rihanna

	- The first of 14 #1 hits for the Barbadian singer; this one samples "Tainted Love" by Soft Cell
	- I would say that this is a grea use of the Tainted Love sample; it keeps the same upbeat and lively feel of the song
	- I really like that chorus; very catchy
	- Rihanna's vocal performace here is pretty good; great control
	
10. "Ridin'" - Chamillionaire feat. Krayzie Bone

	- Hip hop song; featuring former Bone Thugs-N-Harmony signer
	- That's one hell of a beat; another powerful large-in-charge composition
	- Outstanding flows by Chamillionaire, he's really on top of his game here, and the lyrics are pretty solid too
	- Very catchy chorus; "Try to catch me ridin' dirtyyyy!"
	- Bone's feature is equally comparible to Chamillionaire's verses... actually I think it's even better!
	- I was already prone to liking this song since "Weird Al" Yankovic did the "White & Nerdy" parody of this song
	
11. "Hips Don't Lie" - Shakira feat. Wyclef Jean
	
	- Latin/reggaeton song; holds the record for "most played radio song in a single week" in America at 9,637 times
	- Bah, this reminds me too much of the sterile and clean "latin pop" of Ricky Martin; lacks the passion and realness of a proper song from Latin America
	- Also the autotune on Shakira's voice is way too obvious and robotic; but not the T-Pain kind of robotic, the "uncanny valley" kind of robotic
	
12. "Do I Make You Proud" - Taylor Hicks

	- Chalk up another "American Idol" contestant #1 hit; slow pop ballad
	- It has the exact same chord progression of "I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing" by Aerosmith; I never realized how influencial that song was to '00s music...
	- Meh, I guess it's okay; Hicks' voice is pretty solid but the song is pretty bog-standard for a pop ballad

13. "Promiscuous" - Nelly Furtado feat. Timbaland

	- Wow, a love duet #1 hit... first of the decade I think
	- The call-response of the two singers is pretty neat I think
	- Great chorus; solid vocal peroformance
	- Great song overall
	
14. "London Bridge" - Fergie

	- Fergie of Black Eyed Peas fame, scoring her first #1 hit as a solo artist
	- That "Oh, shit!" backing lyric is too damn funny
	- Honestly, the vocal performance by Fergie is really whiney; especially during the chorus
	- I will say, the production and mixing are really good; if only someone other than Fergie sang on it...

15. "SexyBack" - Justin Timberlake

	- Electro-R&B song
	- That beat is so damn catchy and well-done; very funky!
	- Great vocals by Timberlake and company; really suits the song well
	- I love that "take it to the fridge/chorus!" line
	- I never thought a boy band singer could evolve into this, I guess that better than most

16. "Money Maker" - Ludacris feat. Pharrell

	- A hip hop reimagining of the 1961 song "Shake Your Moneymaker" by Elmore James
	- Real cheesy lyrics by Ludacris, I guess that part of the aesthetic, but I can't help but think his tough-rapper persona fits an edgier style

17. "My Love" - Justin Timberlake feat. T.I.

	- Really like those spacey synth chords that drive the song
	- Okay, Timberlake is back to his boy band roots on this one; his falsetto is alright, but not amazing
	- T.I.'s feature is not half-bad, but it's noth enough to make this song that much better

18. "I Wanna Love You" - Akon feat. Snoop Dogg

	- Wow, okay this is literally the most on-the-nose song about sex. The actual name of the song is "I Wanna Fuck You", but I guess it had to be renamed for radio play
	- Akon's voice is so nasally and high-pitched; not really all that great
	- Snoop Dogg's really is going at it on this one; he's got no shame with his verses!
	- I can't believe a song that's this sexual can be so dawdling and boring; They should have got Sir Mix-a-Lot in the studio, he would have done this song justice!

19. "Irreplaceable" - Beyoncé

	- I always thought this song was called "To the left, To the left!" for some reason...
	- I really like the acoustic guitar chord-progression; it really serves the song so well
	- Amazing vocal performance by Beyoncé; there's so much breadth to her voice here and she knocks it out of the park
	- Besides, the "Yaasss Gurrllll... Boss Queen!" energy, it's a fantastic song

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Irreplaceable" - Beyoncé
2. "Ridin'" - Chamillionaire feat. Krayzie Bone
3. "SexyBack" - Justin Timberlake

17. "Hips Don't Lie" - Shakira feat. Wyclef Jean
18. "I Wanna Love You" - Akon feat. Snoop Dogg
19. "Laffy Taffy" - D4L

A massive improvement from last year. this one wasn't outstanding by any means, but this was probably the most diverse year so far this decade.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2007
----

1. "Irreplaceable" - Beyoncé

	- I always thought this song was called "To the left, To the left!" for some reason...
	- I really like the acoustic guitar chord-progression; it really serves the song so well
	- Amazing vocal performance by Beyoncé; there's so much breadth to her voice here and she knocks it out of the park
	- Besides, the "Yaasss Gurrllll... Boss Queen!" energy, it's a fantastic song
	
2. "Say It Right" - Nelly Furtado

	- This is probably the first "Indie" pop song; it's got this stripped down feel to it
	- I really like the reverberated vocals on this one, really makes the song sounds much bigger than it is
	- Great chorus; very powerful sounding
	- I like how the faint electric guitar fades out the song at the end

3. "What Goes Around... Comes Around" - Justin Timberlake

	- Wow, a modern pop song using the bağlama; interesting choice for an intro
	- The minor-key chord progression is pretty neat; never thought I'd see Justin Timberlake doing this
	- Solid chorus; great stacked vocals
	- Timberlake's voice is on-point on this one
	
4. "This Is Why I'm Hot" - Mims

	- Another "Snap" song; I guess Crunk has finally evolved past it's origins
	- Samples a plethora of other rap songs based on region; lyrics reference where Mim's is "hot"
	- Typical bragadocious rap lyrics; they are done good enough, but they could have been better
	- Honestly, this minimalist style of rap is not half-bad; it's like a proto-trap rap of sorts
	
5. "Glamorous" - Fergie feat. Ludacris

	- The whole song is just kinda... boring. It's another one of those "puts-me-to-sleep" songs
	- The lyrics just reek of "first world problems"; oh man, it's so hard being a rich pop star! so relatable, am I right?!
	- I guess Ludacris does an alright job on his verse
	
6. "Don't Matter" - Akon
	
	- "4 Chords" Reggae/R&B song
	- Akon's voice is good on this one. I mean, he's no Marvin Gaye, but it suits the song well
	- Catchy chorus; especially when the song picks up the pace towards the end
	
7. "Give It to Me" - Timbaland feat. Nelly Furtado & Justin Timberlake

	- It's like the three biggest acts at the time came together to make a song together
	- The spooky sounding synths that hid under the beat are kinda neat
	- Solid flows by all involved on this one
	- Great chorus; "giveittomegiveittomegiveittome"!
	
8. "Girlfriend" - Avril Lavigne

	- Teeny-bopper pop punk; I actually remember when the music video for this song came out. I was on YouTube when all of a sudden this blew up and got over a million views in like a day which was insane for 2007-era YouTube
	- I can just imagine it; Lavigne going "Hi! I'm Avril Lavigne, and your watching Disney Channel!" with this playing in the background
	- I guess it's catchy and well-composed, but it just comes off as an even tacker version of "Mickey" by Toni Basil

9. "Makes Me Wonder" - Maroon 5

	- Pop rock dance number; I guess it's worth noting that this is Adam Levine's first #1 hit technically
	- Lavine's voice is pretty good here; I can't help but think he's trying to imitate Marvin Gaye, but hey, I can't blame him
	- This is probably the most well-crafted song I've heard that I just think is "meh"; I feel like I should like it more, but there's just something about this song that makes it not work for me...

10. "Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin') - T-Pain feat. Yung Joc

	- Snap song; literally has "Snap" in the sub-title
	- I have to say it; I actually like the autotune on T-Pain's voice. It's clearly part of the aesthetic; it you listen to his voice without it, it turns out that he's actually pretty solid singer
	- The song's compsition is alright; not quite upbeat, not quite a slow ballad
	- Yung Joc's verse is really not that great; he just sounds bored to be there
	- By the way, T-Pain is now a Twitch Streamer, and he's pretty cool you should check him out
	
11. "Umbrella" - Rihanna feat. Jay-Z

	- Solid drum beat and Jay-Z's opening verse is on-point
	- The chorus is alright; I can't say I like the "umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh," line that much
	- I do like the bridge section; Rihanna's voice is pretty good on it

12. "Hey There Delilah" - Plain White T's

	- Emo band doing an acoustic folk ballad
	- Wow, it's actually just a straight-up acoustic guitar song with vocals. There are some light strings, but either than that it's a very simple song
	- Solid lyrics; a simple song with simple lyrics straight to the point
	- I just realized... this is the '00s version of "Yesterday" by The Beatles; eerily similar

13. "Beautiful Girls" - Sean Kingston

	- A doo-wop song with a '00s R&B production and a hint of reggae
	- Honestly, I like this better than the actual doo-wop that it's imitating
	- I really can't hate on this song too much; it sets out what it wants to do and does it well

14. "Big Girls Don't Cry (Personal)" - Fergie

	- NOT a cover of the Four Seasons song... thank God
	- Pop ballad; acoustic-guitar driven verses
	- Solid vocal work from Fergie on this one; especially during that chorus
	- Fantastic bridge section; well-composed
	
15. "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" - Soulja Boy Tell 'Em

	- Yoooouuuuuuuuuu!
	- Snap song; Our first instructional dance #1 hit since the "Macarena"
	- Jesus, please don't take me back to 8th grade...
	- Mindless song with mindless lyrics that drags on for way too long... but I gotta admit that minimal steel-drum beat is pretty dope

16. "Stronger" - Kanye West

	- Rap song; samples "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" by Daft Punk
	- Okay, this is probably one of the best uses of a sample I've heard in a rap song; it fits sooo well here
	- That beat is so badass; and West's performance is commanding
	- Great use of stop-go/on-off on this one; can't believe it took this long for a song to pull this off

17. "Kiss Kiss" - Chris Brown feat. T-Pain

	- The radio station call-in intro is pretty funny
	- This is probably the most commanding a crunkish song can sound; I gotta commend them for pulling it off
	- Case in point, T-Pain's feature is really on-point
	- I hate to admit that I like a Chris Brown song now... I mean, it's not amazing, but this is probably the best he's ever looked in his entire life (which isn't saying much if you think about it)

18. "No One" - Alicia Keys

	- Jazzy R&B song
	- I hate to say this, but this feels like a poor-man's "Irreplaceable"; everything that song does, this one does just slightly worse
	- Keys' vocal performance is great, but I can't help but think that they should recorded it the next day instead. She's got this horse voice that sounds like the result of recording a whole bunch of songs earlier in the day. I think it would have been better if she just drank some water and got a good night's rest

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Stronger" - Kanye West
2. "Say It Right" - Nelly Furtado

16. "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" - Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
17. "Girlfriend" - Avril Lavigne
18. "Glamorous" - Fergie feat. Ludacris

One of the best years! I never thought one of my favorite years for #1 hits would have been in the 21st century. This was the year of top-notch production quality. A lot of these songs sound timeless; even the "meh" songs sound like they could have been released last year. I'm actually optimistic that future #1 hits will keep up the pace of quality mixes.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2008
----

1. "Low" - Flo Rida feat. T-Pain

	- Crunk song; I first remember hearing this song watching Tom Cruise dancing to this in Tropic Thunder
	- Who knew that speeding up crunk made it better?
	- T-Pain is having too much fun on this one
	- Flo Rida's pretty solid on this one; he's got talent, that's for sure
	
2. "Love in This Club" - Usher feat. Young Jeezy

	- Elecro-R&B; has this skittish "4-Chords" progression
	- Young Jeezy's verse is really out of place here; he's got this very hoarse and aggressive style when this is supposed to be a a love song
	- It's nice and upbeat, but I can't help but think this song is severely lacking in substance

3. "Bleeding Love" - Leona Lewis

	- Another "4-Chords" progression song; R&B ballad
	- Lewis is trying really hard to sound like Mariah Carey here; it's not bad by any means, but it's very obvious
	- The chorus is pretty solid; can't say much else about the song

4. "Touch My Body" - Mariah Carey

	- Speaking of Mariah Carey...
	- Oh god, I remember this song... I first heard this song sung in a video by a japanese guy in very poor english... so I guess this was a real song afer all!
	- Never though this late in here career she would release her most provocative song; also this is clearly some kind of joke song she made that somehow became a #1 hit. The lyrics are kinda silly and the music video that accompanys the song is pretty friggin' hilarious
	- Oh yeah, I guess the songs pretty good too

5. "Lollipop" - Lil' Wayne feat. Static Major

	- Hip hop song; another posthumous #1 hit, released shortly after Static Major's death
	- Holy shit... Lil' Wayne is like... trying REAL hard to sound ridiculous on this one. and the warbly autotune just make it even worse
	- The half-assed electric-guitar sprinkled throughout the song is also pretty bad too, and I'm not even refering to Wayne's piss-poor attempts to play this live on guitar. I mean the actual mix has this terrible guitar lick that plays
	- Honestly, Static Major is the only good thing about this song
	
6. "Take a Bow" - Rihanna

	- Man, we really are going hard this year with the "4-Chords" songs...
	- Meh, it's okay. It's probably the most sterile and vanilla R&B song to use this progression I've heard so far

7. "Viva la Vida" - Coldplay

	- Interesting, a "Baroque pop" song; heavy use of strings on this one
	- Besides Chris Martin's vocal performance being good; the whole song just kind of drags on. It feels like it's building up to something, but there really isn't a pay-off of any kind

8. "I Kissed a Girl" - Katy Perry

	- Nothing like a song about a sexually repressed girl discovering that she might be a lesbian!
	- I guess I got to give Katy Perry some credit for trying to make a gay anthem, but it just comes off so fake, like "Hey! I'm a lesbian! Ain't I just sooo quirky?!"
	- The production and mixing is so plastic and fake-sounding that it really brings the song down
	
9. "Disturbia" - Rihanna

	- Electro-pop song about being mentally disturbed; written by Chris Brown
	- Actually, this song makes more sense when you consider the fact that it was written by Chris Brown...
	- I don't know, it's catchy and upbeat, but it's really nothing too special

10. "Whatever You Like" - T.I.

	- Pop rap song
	- Bah, another basic, boring, love rap song

11. "So What" - Pink

	- Pop rock song
	- Wow, this is some of the most try-hard "I'm edgy and cool! I'm a rockstar!" lyrics I've ever heard. It's a like the ramblings of a drunk white girl
	- The production is also overbearing and generic as hell
	
12. "Live Your Life" - T.I. feat. Rihanna

	- Oh god... this samples the "Numa Numa" meme song...
	- Very upbeat and driven; has this optimistic feel to it
	- T.I.'s flow and lyrics are actually pretty solid; not a half-bad message either
	- Rihanna really owns that chorus and  bridge section; elevates the song
	

13. "Womanizer" - Britney Spears

	- Jesus, can we please get a song that DOESN'T have a plastic and sterile production?
	- I guess I like the decending synth riff during the chorus, but everything about this song is just lame

14. "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" - Beyoncé

	- "Yo, Taylor... I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the BEST music videos of ALL TIME!" said Kayne West during one of his manic episodes at the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards
	- It's great to hear another fantastic vocal performace by Beyoncé, but unfortunately this song suffers from an over-bearing and noisey production

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Live Your Life" - T.I. feat. Rihanna
2. "Low" - Flo Rida feat. T-Pain
3. "Touch My Body" - Mariah Carey
4. "Bleeding Love" - Leona Lewis

11. "Womanizer" - Britney Spears
12. "So What" - Pink
13. "I Kissed a Girl" - Katy Perry
14. "Lollipop" - Lil' Wayne feat. Static Major

...aaaannnndddd now we are back down at the bottom. NOT a good year. Most of these songs suffer from an overdone and generic production. "Yeah, just throw up a basic 808 beat, some cheap built-in synths, crank that shit up to 11 with not proper mixing, and call it a day... that's all it takes to make a #1 hit!" Said every producer in 2008; really wishing for 2006/07 Timbaland to come back...

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2009
----

1. "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" - Beyoncé

	- "Yo, Taylor... I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the BEST music videos of ALL TIME!" said Kayne West during one of his manic episodes at the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards
	- It's great to hear another fantastic vocal performace by Beyoncé, but unfortunately this song suffers from an over-bearing and noisey production

2. "Just Dance" - Lady Gaga feat. Colby O'Donis

	- Electro-pop song; heavy use of synths
	- I really like that main synth line; so mezmerizing
	- Gaga's voice suits the song very well; kind of reminds me of Cher
	- Actually, I think all of the synths are top-notch!
	- O'Donis' verse isn't half-bad either
	- That little breakdown in the middle is great; the two vocal lines going at the same time was a great creative decision

3. "My Life Would Suck Without You" - Kelly Clarkson

	- I kind of like the clean electric-guitar riff that plays throughout
	- Can't say I like the chorus; it's so loud and over-produced
	- Clarkson's voice is pretty decent here, but the rest of the song is pretty forgetable

4. "Crack a Bottle" - Eminem feat. Dr. Dre & 50 Cent

	- The boxing announcer intro is pretty funny; Eminem is rapping as his "alter-ego", Slim Shady on this one
	- The chorus is kinda lame and sounds like it would better fit in a 'N Sync song barring the lyrics
	- Dr. Dre and 50 Cent's verses aren't half-bad, but it really can't make up for the boring production
	
5. "Right Round" - Flo Rida feat. Kesha

	- Rap song; samples Dead Or Alive's massive '80s hit song, "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"
	- I remember hearing this song for the first at the end credits to the film "The Hangover"
	- The chorus isn't really anything special, it's basically the same as the song that it samples; might as well listen to the original in that case
	- Flo Rida's triplet flow is pretty solid on this one; besides that, it's a pretty tacky and plastic-sounding song

6. "Poker Face" - Lady Gaga

	- Another Electropop #1 hit by Lady Gaga
	- The poker references in the lyrics are pretty clever, I must say
	- Another great vocal performace by Gaga; also very catchy chorus
	- I can't hide this; the "Puh puh puh poker face puh puh poker face" line is absurdly cheesy

7. "Boom Boom Pow" - The Black Eyed Peas

	- Massive hit; #1 for 12 consectutive weeks
	- Suprisingly minimal; just a simple 808 beat and some eerie synths
	- The lyrics are straight-up club trash, but I don't know if I can really demean the song for that... it's literally a club song
	- The breakdown is pretty damn good

8. "I Gotta Feeling" - The Black Eyed Peas

	- ANOTHER massive hit by The Black Eyed Peas. This time at #1 for 14 consectutive weeks, making them have the longest streak at #1 for a group at 26 weeks!
	- This one's more upbeat and cheery; the lyrics are also pretty postive
	- Another mindless club song, but unlike their last #1 hit, this one's got some lazy lyrics and is over-produced to hell and back

9. "Down" - Jay Sean feat. Lil' Wayne

	- Electro-pop song; uses some string synths for it's main progession
	- It's like listening to a dollar-store Justin Timberlake. I mean, his voice sounds good and all, bit I can't help but picture Timberlake in my head
	- How the hell did Lil' Wayne even have a career? This dude is hot garbage; can't write a rap verse worth a shit, and the gimmick of throwing a warbly autotune over his voice wears thin IMMEDIATELY

10. "3" - Britney Spears

	- Educational electro-pop song; teaches the listener how to count to 3
	- In all seriousness, it's a pretty bog-standard song for the genre; I'm just glad that it has a decent production. It's mixed well and Spear's voice is pretty good on this one

11. "Fireflies" - Owl City

	- Alt rock/Synth-pop song; I remember how every CGI-animated film around this time used this band's music for every montage and ending credits roll, but I somehow managed to not hear this one song until MANY YEARS later
	- The main synth line is pretty quirky and neat
	- The vocoder vocals is pretty neat too; reminds me of Daft Punk
	- Another case of really silly lyrics, but I guess they fit the song well enough
	
12. "Whatcha Say" - Jason Derulo

	- R&B song; samples the 2005 song "Hide and Seek" by Imogen Heap
	- Another case of "uncanny valley" use of autotune; they probably should have just went all the way with it like T-Pain on this one
	- Really forgetable; indistinguishable from many songs from the time

13. "Empire State of Mind" - Jay-Z feat. Alicia Keys

	- Hip hop song about New York City and the last #1 hit of the '00s decade; can Jay-Z finish these past 10 years strong?
	- I think he can. This song was made for a rapper like him; his lyrics and flow are really on point here
	- Wow, that chorus is soooo good! Keys' voice carries the song like how Atlas carries the earth
	- The sample choice of "Love on a Two-Way Street" by The Moments was genius; really suits the vibe of the song so well here

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Empire State of Mind" - Jay-Z feat. Alicia Keys
2. "Poker Face" - Lady Gaga
3. "Just Dance" - Lady Gaga feat. Colby O'Donis
4. "Fireflies" - Owl City
5. "Boom Boom Pow" - The Black Eyed Peas
6. "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" - Beyoncé
7. "3" - Britney Spears
8. "Crack a Bottle" - Eminem feat. Dr. Dre & 50 Cent
9. "Right Round" - Flo Rida feat. Kesha
10. "I Gotta Feeling" - The Black Eyed Peas
11. "My Life Would Suck Without You" - Kelly Clarkson
12. "Whatcha Say" - Jason Derulo
13. "Down" - Jay Sean feat. Lil' Wayne

An alright last year for the '00s decade; can't say much either than that I'm disappointed that the production quality went from decent, to bad, to really good, to horrible in the span of just 10 years. You'd think by the time we got to the iPhone, 1080p, digital streaming part of the decade, the quality of the music would be better, but it just really isn't there. However, I'm still hopeful of the 2010s. I do remember liking some of the stuff that came out during my last two years of High School, and even some of the stuff that came out while I was working and going to College. I can only hope that I can finish this project feeling like It ended on a high note, so let's go!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2010
----

1. "Tik Tok" - Kesha

	- Electro-pop song
	- Sorry folks, I really don't like the drunk white valley-girl aesthetic that Kesha did for most of her career
	- Chorus is pretty solid though; probably the only part of the song that I like

2. "Imma Be" - The Black Eyed Peas

	- Jesus Christ, that will.i.am hook is so obnoxious, but I've heard worse
	- I do like the backing vocals behind Fergie's main vocals
	- Whoa, that key change is pretty good, and the way the song picks up the pace suits the key change well

3. "Break Your Heart" - Taio Cruz feat. Ludacris

	- Another Electro-pop song
	- The self-referencial rap verse that Ludacris opens with the song is really cheesy
	- This sounds like "Square Hammer" by Ghost; I guess a Swedish metal band stole this song? xD
	- Besides the good vocal performace by Cruz, the whole song sounds really generic
	
4. "Rude Boy" - Rihanna

	- Elecro-R&B song with a hint of Dancehall; really bringing her Caribbean roots to this one
	- Solid chorus; very catchy
	- Wow, this one's pretty sexual; very provocative
	- It's a good song, but I do think the mixing is pretty weak; everything's way too loud

5. "Nothin' on You" - B.o.B feat. Bruno Mars

	- Everyone's favorite flat-earther rapper!
	- The chorus by Mars is okay, kinda basic
	- The verses by B.o.B are pretty good; solid flow and good lyrics
	- I never thought I ever hear "Nintendo 64" as a lyric in a #1 hit song! xD

6. "OMG" - Usher feat. will.i.am

	- Elecro-R&B song; first time we've seen a text message short-hand in a song title so far
	- Those backing "Ohhhhhh" vocals are pretty catchy; it's like I'm at a sporting event
	- The lyrics by Usher are a little cheesy, but I guess you can only do so much with a song premise like this one
	- Wow, if I wasn't watching the music video for the song, I may have missed the will.i.am verse; they sound so similar!

7. "Not Afraid" - Eminem

	- I think this is first time we've seen Eminem soften his sound for a more pop appeal; looks like it worked out for him if he's topping the charts again
	- Solid chorus; Eminem's stacked vocals really make it sound a lot bigger
	- Another case of great lyrics and flow by Eminem; he really is deserving of the praise he gets, he's just a really good rapper
	- Wow, he even mentions his lackluster previous record; it's like he's got the same opinion as me on his song "Crack a Bottle"!
	- The bridge is also pretty good too

8. "California Gurls" - Katy Perry feat. Snoop Dogg

	- Electro-pop song; NOT a cover of The Beach Boys song
	- Very hoppy and bouncy; I love that funk bass line too
	- Great chorus; it's like a way better version of the chorus of "Tik Tok" by Kesha
	- Man, Snoop Dogg will do anything for a paycheck will he? Beside that, his verse isn't half-bad
	- Wow, the "California Love" Tupac reference at the end is pretty cheeky
	
9. "Love the Way You Lie" - Eminem feat. Rihanna

	- Wow, this is probably the single-most depressing, masochistic song to hit #1
	- Great vocal performace by Rihanna on the chorus; very powerful
	- Good performace by Eminem, as usual
	- Eminem, my dude... Who hurt you man?
	
10. "Teenage Dream" - Katy Perry

	- I love that clean electric-guitar riff that drives the song
	- That's one hell of a chorus; love that vocal cadence
	- The post-chorus is even better!
	- I'm impressed. Katy Perry got a lot better over the course of two years; now she's making some solid pop music

11. "Just The Way You Are" - Bruno Mars

	- Love ballad
	- I really love that drum beat; very funky
	- Great lyrics and good vocal cadence by Mars
	- Very pleasant chorus; well-performed
	- It's great to hear a straight-forward pop song like this one; reminds me of the traditional pop of the early '60s

12. "Like a G6" - Far East Movement feat. The Cataracs & Dev

	- First Asian act to reach #1 since "Sukiyaki" by Kyu Sakamoto in 1963
	- It may be club trash, but it's really good trash
	- These guys don't fuck around; they go all out with the "I'm in the club, let's get wasted!" vibe. The beat, the lyrics, the delivery, it's all very in-your-face; THIS is how you write a hedonistic song!

13. "We R Who We R" - Kesha

	- Practically the same song as "Tik Tok"; just a bit different lyrics and beat
	- The forced stuttered vocals is really cheesy
	- I guess it's a bit better than "Tik Tok"
	
14. "What's My Name?" - Rihanna feat. Drake

	- Rihanna is your name, silly!
	- First #1 hit for Canadian rapper Drake
	- Man, Drake's verse has got a good flow, but the lyrics and the smooth delivery is so tacky
	- The chorus by Rihanna is pretty good; I like the patois she puts on it
	
15. "Only Girl (In the World)" - Rihanna

	- Oh wow, we got a Eurodance song by Rihanna this time!
	- I really like that chorus; very powerful and catchy
	- Probably just a club song, but it's really good for what it is

16. "Raise Your Glass" - Pink

	- Is that a "Dark Knight" reference with that "Why so serious?" lyric? I guess Pink is The Joker now
	- Meh, I guess it's alright; Her attempts at comedy in a bog-standard pop song kinda fall flat here

17. "Firework" - Katy Perry

	- I guess this is my generation's self-empowerment anthem...
	- I really like how the song builds up to that chorus; very powerful vocal performace by Perry
	- Solid bridge section too!
	- Honestly, It's pretty good; I would've thought a song like this would've had a bunch of bottle-poppin references since that's the only music I remember from 11 years ago, but this one's pretty clean and timeless

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Teenage Dream" - Katy Perry
2. "Just The Way You Are" - Bruno Mars
3. "California Gurls" - Katy Perry feat. Snoop Dogg

14. "Raise Your Glass" - Pink
15. "We R Who We R" - Kesha
16. "Tik Tok" - Kesha
17. "Break Your Heart" - Taio Cruz feat. Ludacris

Not a half-bad year. There were some duds, but overall a pretty solid showing; That over-bearing production quality is still there for the most part, the songs themselves are getting better in this new modern era of pop music; I really hope the only pathway is up, 'cause I really don't want to have to listen to anymore loud-ass mixes.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2011
----

1. "Firework" - Katy Perry

	- I guess this is my generation's self-empowerment anthem...
	- I really like how the song builds up to that chorus; very powerful vocal performace by Perry
	- Solid bridge section too!
	- Honestly, It's pretty good; I would've thought a song like this would've had a bunch of bottle-poppin references since that's the only music I remember from 11 years ago, but this one's pretty clean and timeless

2. "Grenade" - Bruno Mars

	- Slow pop ballad
	- A bit of a weird premise for a love song; Mars, my man. You're upset she WOULDN'T jump on a grenade for you? What kind of lunatic are you?!
	- Solid vocal performance by Mars, but the song is dawdling as hell

3. "Hold It Against Me" - Britney Spears

	- Dance-pop song
	- Oh my god, it's got a dub-step breakdown... Nothing dates a song to the early '10s like one of those! (I still like it though...)
	- I guess it's catchy enough, but it's really nothing too special
	
4. "Black and Yellow" - Wiz Khalifa

	- Hip hop song; it's got this extremely repetitive hook, but I guess it's catchy
	- I remember when people thought this song was about the Pittsburg Steelers despite the VERY OBVIOUS sports car references throughout the whole song
	- Solid flow by Khalifa; not half-bad
	
5. "Born This Way" - Lady Gaga

	- Gay anthem about being proud of who you are; very reminiscent of the '90s dance club music that was associate with the gay community
	- Okay... this is probably one of the WORST mixed songs I've heard so far. It's SO DAMN LOUD; I can barely hear the vocals amongst the cacophony

6. "E.T." Katy Perry feat. Kanye West

	- West's opening verse is pretty solid
	- The vocal cadence of Perry is pretty good; fits the song well
	- Another over-produced chorus; they really couldn't help but crank every instrument up to 11
	- West's second verse is a little bit weak; also the lyrics are absolutely hilarious
	
7. "S&M" - Rihanna feat. Britney Spears

	- Eurodance remix featuring Britney Spears; take a guess at what this song is about
	- Solid chorus; very catchy and that synth riff helps alot
	- Kind of weird listening to this song after her, let's just say, "rocky" relationship with Chris Brown
	
8. "Rolling in the Deep" - Adele

	- Soul song; When I first heard this song, I thought it was an Amy Winehouse song
	- Great vocal performance by Adele; especially during that chorus
	- It's cool to hear a song like this one, heavily inspired by '60s soul, top the chart during a year of over-produced robotic music
	
9. "Give Me Everything" - Pitbull feat. Ne-Yo, Afrojack & Nayer

	- Club trash; pretty much the only place I can imagine it being played
	- It's not half-bad, for what it's worth; Ne-Yo sounds pretty good on that chorus
	- Pitbull's rap verses are also pretty decent

10. "Party Rock Anthem" - LMFAO feat. Lauren Bennett & GoonRock

	- Electro-dance song; Not a rock song, by the way
	- What the hell was that lyric? "No lead in our zeppelin!" I guess that's the "rock" part of the song
	- I always thought the "everyday I'm shufflin'" line was funny
	- It's like they were trying to make the most infectious dance song ever, and I guess they succeeded

11. "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" - Katy Perry

	- "Drunken white girl" The Song
	- I guess it's catchy and well-performed, but the lyrics are just so cringy. "T.G.I.F."? I don't know if God approves of your lifestyle, Katy
	- Wait, what?! A sax solo? Well that was unexpected
	- Okay, supposedly this was written as a response to Kesha's songs about the same topic, so I guess it's tongue-in-cheek?

12. "Moves Like Jagger" - Maroon 5 feat. Christina Aguilera

	- Pop rock song about the Rolling Stones frontman, or I guess it's about his "moves" 
	- The whistle-hook is kinda neat; and the funk guitar is nice to listen to
	- Catchy chorus; Adam Levine's peroformance on this song is pretty solid
	- Aguilera's verse isn't anything too special; they really could've had anyone featured and It wouldn't have made a difference

13. "Someone Like You" - Adele

	- Piano ballad; literally just a piano and Adele's voice.
	- That piano progression is so good; It's nice to hear just a dry piano on a song sometimes
	- Great vocal performance by Adele; I guess that's par for the course for her
	- Great bridge section; I love the stacked vocals that come in

14. "We Found Love" - Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris

	- Electro-dance song
	- Good electric piano hook; very catchy
	- Rihanna's vocal performance is really on-point here
	- Can't have an early 2010s club song without a bass drop
	- I think this is a great song, but it suffers from over-production like many songs of it's era

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Someone Like You" - Adele
2. "Rolling in the Deep" - Adele
3. "We Found Love" - Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris

12. "Grenade" - Bruno Mars
13. "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" - Katy Perry
14. "Born This Way" - Lady Gaga

About the same quality as last year, plus the same loud-ass production jobs. The "Loudness War" rages on!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2012
----

1. "Sexy and I Know It" - LMFAO

	- Another Electro-pop song by LMFAO
	- The rap verses are very silly, plus the "I work out!" refrain and the "wigglewigglewiggle" line
	- Basically the same song as "Party Rock Anthem", just a bit more silly

2. "We Found Love" - Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris

	- Electro-dance song
	- Good electric piano hook; very catchy
	- Rihanna's vocal performance is really on-point here
	- Can't have an early 2010s club song without a bass drop
	- I think this is a great song, but it suffers from over-production like many songs of it's era
	
3. "Set Fire to the Rain" - Adele

	- This one's very similar to "Someone Like You" but a bit more upbeat
	- Solid pre-chorus and chorus; great vocal performance by Adele
	- Great outro; good to see someone putting in the effort to make the last 30 seconds of a song great
	- I like this one, but I think her previous #1 hits from last year were better
	
4. "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" - Kelly Clarkson

	- Meh, a bog-standard pop song; I guess Clarkson's vocal performance is good, but not enough to make up for the loud-mix

5. "We Are Young" - fun. feat. Janelle Monáe

	- Indie pop song; blew up after it was featured in the TV show Glee and in a Super Bowl commercial
	- The military rhythm is kinda neat
	- Whoa, the slows down the bpm after the first verse; interesting musical choice for a pop song
	- The vocal performance is pretty solid
	- I really like when Monáe's part comes in; when all of the vocal parts come in and stack
	- Interesting song, but it's really nothing too special; there are definitely better indie songs

6. "Somebody That I Used to Know" - Gotye feat. Kimbra

	- Speaking of better indie songs...
	- I really love that acoustic-guitar riff; plus an honest-to-God xylophone!
	- The sublety of the instruments throughout the whole song is just great
	- Great chorus; very powerful vocal performance
	- Wow, I'm impressed by Kimbra's verse; the way it flows into the chorus is just great composition
	
7. "Call Me Maybe" - Carly Rae Jepsen

	- Teeny-bopper song
	- It's like a much better version of "Girlfriend" by Avril Lavigne; better composition overall
	- Solid chorus; I like the use of those orchestral stabs
	- I'm just glad to hear a modern pop song with proper mixing

8. "Whistle" - Flo Rida

	- "Will you blow my whistle baby?" NOT AT ALL a sexual innuendo
	- I guess the acoustic-guitar is kinda neat
	- Solid flows by Flo Rida; can't complain
	- Probably the closest thing to a novelty #1 song we've heard in this new millennium
	
9. "We Are Never Getting Back Together" - Taylor Swift

	- Country star turned pop star; I guess if it worked for Kenny Rodgers and Dolly Parton, I guess it could work for Swift
	- I really like that guitar riff; can't say the same for the insufferable bubblegum pop lyrics
	- Solid vocal performance by Swift, not enough to make up for the tackiness of the song
	
10. "One More Night" - Maroon 5

	- NOT a cover of the Phil Collins #1 hit song
	- Fun fact, this was the song that kept "Gangnam Style" by Psy out of the top spot; it was at this point that Billboard decided to include YouTube views into their determinations from here on out
	- Wow, it's actually kinda funky
	- Catchy chorus; plus those drums are on-point
	
11. "Diamonds" - Rihanna

	- Meh, it's alright; kinda of a bog-standard pop song, honestly
	
12. "Locked Out Of Heaven" - Bruno Mars

	- Funk rock song
	- The "whoop whoop whoop whoop, ooh!" line that is repeated throughout the whole song is kinda tacky
	- The laid back rhythm is refreshing to hear
	- I really wish the chorus didn't have that electronic rhythm; I think it would sound better if it stuck to the dry instrumentation
	- Mars' vocals are top-notch on this one, I gotta admit

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Somebody That I Used to Know" - Gotye feat. Kimbra
2. "Set Fire to the Rain" - Adele
3. "We Found Love" - Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris
4. "One More Night" - Maroon 5
5. "Locked Out Of Heaven" - Bruno Mars
6. "Call Me Maybe" - Carly Rae Jepsen
7. "We Are Young" - fun. feat. Janelle Monáe
8. "Diamonds" - Rihanna

10. "Whistle" - Flo Rida
11. "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" - Kelly Clarkson
12. "Sexy and I Know It" - LMFAO

Another slight improvement. As each year goes on, the better the mixes become. It's like producers are starting to understand that cranking up your instruments to 11 doesn't equal a good song. It's also cool to see how indie music is influencing the pop scene. I look forward to next year!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2013
----

1. "Locked Out Of Heaven" - Bruno Mars

	- Funk rock song
	- The "whoop whoop whoop whoop, ooh!" line that is repeated throughout the whole song is kinda tacky
	- The laid back rhythm is refreshing to hear
	- I really wish the chorus didn't have that electronic rhythm; I think it would sound better if it stuck to the dry instrumentation
	- Mars' vocals are top-notch on this one, I gotta admit
	
2. "Thrift Shop" - Macklemore & Ryan Lewis feat. Wanz

	- Comedic hip hop song about thrifting; I remember when I first heard this, I thought it was some lost Beastie Boys song, but then realized it was very much NOT them
	- The new jack swing intro rhythm is pretty neat
	- I really like the main saxaphone line; very catchy
	- These lyrics are so hilarious; I like it when a artist doesn't take themselves to seriously
	
3. "Harlem Shake" - Baauer

	- Wow, our first instrumental #1 hit song since the '80s
	- Oh wait... I distinctly remember this one. Senior year of high school; supposedly there was going to be a flash mob of people dancing to this song, but got shut down by the Vice Principle
	- It's a catchy club track, but I can't say I reminisce about this fad dance song. I mean, it's really nothing too special
	
4. "When I Was Your Man" - Bruno Mars
	
	- Sad piano ballad
	- I remember this girl at my high school who covered this song on guitar for a talent show; it was really good, but she didn't win; she lost to another girl who did a cup-stacking & ukulele cover of "Sexy And I Know It" by LMFAO
	- It's a pretty good song; I think this is even better than most of the "classic" piano ballads of previous decades, by far
	
5. "Just Give Me a Reason" - Pink feat. Nate Ruess

	- Another piano ballad; features the singer from fun.
	- Great piano composition and vocal performance by Pink
	- I like how the primal percussion is added during the first chorus
	- Ruess' feature is also on-point; great harmonization with Pink

6. "Can't Hold Us" - Macklemore & Ryan Lewis feat. Ray Dalton

	- Solid string-section intro; does kind of drag on on for a minute though
	- Macklemore's flows are pretty solid; can't say much else though
	- The best part is the chorus sung by Ray Dalton; he's got a good voice and it's very motivating
	- The switch from strings to horns in the second half is a very creative composition choice
	- Great "na na na na" part towards the end; very singable
	
7. "Blurred Lines" - Robin Thicke feat. T.I. & Pharrell Williams

	- I friggin' HATE this song. Not because it's bad (It's actually very good) but because it kept "Get Lucky" by Daft Punk out of the #1 spot for the WHOLE DAMN SUMMER!
	- Eerily similar to "Gotta Give It Up" by Marvin Gaye; so much so that the Marvin Gaye Estate sued and won against Thicke and company which I think is complete bullshit
	- Damn funky; Thicke's, T.I.'s, and Williams' verses are top-notch; great voices that suit the song very well
	
8. "Roar" - Katy Perry

	- Big, huge power pop anthem; references "Eye Of The Tiger" by Survivor and "We Are The Champions" by Queen
	- Great chorus; very catchy and singable
	- Solid vocal performance by Perry; she's also got great vocal cadence on this one
	
9. "Wrecking Ball" - Miley Cyrus

	- This one's got an '80s pop feel to it; almost like a Bonnie Tyler or Sheena Easton song
	- Great vocal control by Cyrus; solid range
	- I like the "4-chords" chorus; very catchy
	
10. "Royals" - Lorde

	- Minimalistic indie pop song; youngest solo female artist to score a #1 hit song; Lorde being 16 years old at the time of recording.
	- Damn, she's younger than I am! I guess that makes this the first #1 hit song by someone who was born after August 10th, 1995
	- I really like the reverb over the whole song; very pleasant
	- Catchy chorus and I love those vocal harmonies throughout the song
	- This is probably the best soul #1 hit song I've heard since the '60s
	
11. "The Monster" - Eminem feat. Rihanna

	- Great chorus by Rihanna; I think this one's better than the last one they did together
	- Eminem with a solid performance; neat lyrics too
	- Just a great song, overall; not much else to say
	
OVERALL RANKING

1. "Royals" - Lorde
2. "Blurred Lines" - Robin Thicke feat. T.I. & Pharrell Williams
3. "The Monster" - Eminem feat. Rihanna

8. "Thrift Shop" - Macklemore & Ryan Lewis feat. Wanz
9. "Wrecking Ball" - Miley Cyrus
10. "Locked Out Of Heaven" - Bruno Mars
11. "Harlem Shake" - Baauer

We did it! We survived the "Loudness War"! Bravo! A pretty good year overall; well-produced, well-performed, and quite creative. This was probably the single-most creative year for #1 hit songs, which is saying something. I mean, the '60s are long gone but we got artists here in 2013 exploring some cool ideas!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2014
----

1. "The Monster" - Eminem feat. Rihanna

	- Great chorus by Rihanna; I think this one's better than the last one they did together
	- Eminem with a solid performance; neat lyrics too
	- Just a great song, overall; not much else to say
	
2. "Timber" - Pitbull feat. Kesha

	- EDM club song with a western country feel
	- Kesha's attempt at a southern accent is laughable; Kesha... you're from LA
	- Pitbull's flow is fairly solid, but it's really nothing to special
	- Meh, the whole song is kinda boring if you ask me
	
3. "Dark Horse" - Kate Perry feat. Juicy J

	- The rap call-out in the intro is pretty tacky; why do rapper do that?
	- I like the maion synth line; very mystic and spooky
	- Lyrics are a bit confusing, does Katy Perry even know what a "Dark Horse" is?
	- The build-up during the chorus to that "There's no goin' back" drop is pretty neat; very subtle and not over the top
	- Juicy J's verse is so hilarious; I feel like he should have worked on those lyrics a bit more; "She'll eat your heart out... like Jeffrey Dahmer!"
	
4. "Happy" - Pharrell Williams

	- Soul song; written for the film "Dispicable Me 2"
	- Well, it is indeed a very "happy" song; extremely upbeat
	- I love the clap-breakdown in the middle and towards the end; very catchy and great
	- It's a good song, but I do feel like it drags on for too long; maybe shave off a chorus or add another verse
	
5. "All of Me" - John Legend

	- Piano ballad; literally just Legend's voice and his piano
	- Very somber piano chord-progression; I like it
	- Legend's voice is on-point here; very soaring
	- Great lyrics; simple and effective
	- I like how we get those stacked vocals towards the end, adds a nice bit of flavor to the song
	
6. "Fancy" - Iggy Azalea feat. Charli XCX

	- That simple beat is pretty good, I must admit; I like a song with a minimal feel to it
	- Feels a lot like "Like a G6"; it's all about the excesses of being a rapper; it is a bit weird that this White Aussie girl is rapping about being a "murderah"
	- Charli XCX's vocal performance on the chorus is pretty solid; also the bridge is pretty good too
	
7. "Rude" - Magic!

	- A... reggae song? Wow, that's a bit of an anomoly
	- Honestly this song's lyrics are just so boring and whiny; dude... why do you want her dad's blessing? Just marry her already! She isn't his property!
	- I do kinda like the guitar solo; kinda reminds me of Prince a bit
	
8. "Shake It Off" - Taylor Swift

	- Upbeat dance pop song
	- The chorus is pretty catchy; I like how each line decends down the Major Scale
	- The bridge is kinda of a silly ode to "Hey Mickey" by Toni Basil; I guess I like it
	
9. "All About That Bass" - Meghan Trainor

	- Another Bubblegum pop revival song with a hip hop tingle; this time it's a fat-acceptance song!
	- Very clever lyrics; kinda aggressive, but is ultimately a postive-minded song
	- Kinda wished they actually committed to the principle of the song when making the music video; I would NOT call any of the backup dancers or even Trainor herself over-weight AT ALL


10. "Blank Space" - Taylor Swift

	- Very minimal pop song; simple beat with a subtle synth
	- Really love the composition of the song, the way that the verse flows into the chorus, and the way the chorus leads into the post-chorus; very well done
	- Great bridge; gotta love those stacked vocals
	- Just a really well-made pop song; Swift and company really gave it their all on this one
	
OVERALL RANKING

1. "Blank Space" - Taylor Swift
2. "The Monster" - Eminem feat. Rihanna

7. "Dark Horse" - Kate Perry feat. Juicy J
8. "Fancy" - Iggy Azalea feat. Charli XCX
9. "Rude" - Magic!
10. "Timber" - Pitbull feat. Kesha

This was an alright year, not terrible, but not super amazing either. I'm just glad the songs sound good now. No more bad mixing, no more bad production jobs. Of course the songs should be able to shine on their own, and some of these songs were a bit of a miss for me.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2015
----

1. "Blank Space" - Taylor Swift

	- Very minimal pop song; simple beat with a subtle synth
	- Really love the composition of the song, the way that the verse flows into the chorus, and the way the chorus leads into the post-chorus; very well done
	- Great bridge; gotta love those stacked vocals
	- Just a really well-made pop song; Swift and company really gave it their all on this one
	
2. "Uptown Funk" - Mark Ronson feat. Bruno Mars

	- Funk throwback song
	- Immaculate instrumentation; the bass, the slinky guitar, the drum kit, the synths, the horns, it's flawless
	- Great chorus; the build-up to it is amazing
	- Funny lyrics; tongue-in-cheek, but fits the song very well
	- The story behind this song is quite interesting; Ronson and Mars were in the studio, and were basically on a mission to make the funkiest song ever, and I think they may have succeeded
	
3. "See You Again" - Wiz Khalifa feat. Charlie Puth

	- Written for the film "Furious 7" as a tribute to recently passed Fast & Furious actor, Paul Walker
	- Solid piano progession; very somber and yet powerful
	- Puth's vocals on the chorus is pretty solid, and Khalifa's flows are on-point
	- The mixing on this song is so good; very well-balanced and pleasant
	
4. "Bad Blood" - Taylor Swift feat. Kendrick Lamar

	- NOT a cover of the #1 hit song by Neil Sedaka
	- Wow, Lamar's verses are so on-point; he's a great rapper
	- Swift's vocal performance on the pre-chorus, chorus, and bridge are really good as well
	- Another well-mixed song; This is exciting!
	
5. "Cheerleader" - Omi feat. Jaehn

	- A bit of a reggae pop song; reminds me of Akon a bit
	- I really like the samba-feel of the song; especially with that piano
	- A very tasteful trumpet throughout the song
	- I just realized... this is almost a perfect copy of "You Can Call Me Al" by Paul Simon
	
6. "Can't Feel My Face" - The Weeknd

	- A dark-synthy R&B song; has an '80s feel to it
	- Wow, fantastic voice on The Weeknd; great pipes
	- The bass-funk of the chorus is top-notch
	- The use of backing vocals towards the end is fantastic
	
7. "What Do You Mean?" - Justin Bieber

	- Solid piano chord-progression; complements the "tick-tock" rhythm well
	- Whoa, are those steel drums and pan flutes? I like it
	- Bieber's airy vocals aren't half-bad either
	
8. "The Hills" - The Weeknd

	- The first proper "Trap" Rap song to hit #1; Let's see how this sub-genre can hold up for the rest of the decade
	- Now that's one hell of a way to start a song with those sharp dark-synth stabs; I like it
	- The simple beat with those somber vocals are a great creative choice
	- Great chorus; very smooth in it's delivery, and yet so rough in timbre
	
9. "Hello" - Adele

	- This is a slow piano ballad, but it is NOT a cover or Lionel Richie's #1 hit "Hello"
	- This piano chord-progression is probably the single best one I've heard so far for a sad ballad; simple yet effective
	- Fantastic chorus; very powerful and sad
	- Okay, this one's even better than "Someone Like You"; The slower, somber feel of this one really elevates it to another level
	
OVERALL RANKING

1. "Uptown Funk" - Mark Ronson feat. Bruno Mars
2. "Hello" - Adele
3. "See You Again" - Wiz Khalifa feat. Charlie Puth
4. "Blank Space" - Taylor Swift
5. "The Hills" - The Weeknd
6. "Can't Feel My Face" - The Weeknd
7. "Bad Blood" - Taylor Swift feat. Kendrick Lamar
8. "Cheerleader" - Omi feat. Jaehn
9. "What Do You Mean?" - Justin Bieber

Don't let the ranking above fool you. EVERY SINGLE TRACK was a great song this year. I can't believe that I found my favorite year for #1 hits this far into the project! I really can't say one negative thing about any of these songs, they're just great. I mean, not ALL of them are legendary masterpieces or anything, but they all have some really good qualities worth listening to.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2016
----

1. "Hello" - Adele

	- This is a slow piano ballad, but it is NOT a cover or Lionel Richie's #1 hit "Hello"
	- This piano chord-progression is probably the single best one I've heard so far for a sad ballad; simple yet effective
	- Fantastic chorus; very powerful and sad
	- Okay, this one's even better than "Someone Like You"; The slower, somber feel of this one really elevates it to another level
	
2. "Sorry" - Justin Bieber

	- A sort of dancehall song with a '90s synth pop feel
	- I'm liking the use of those electric trumpet samples
	- The triplet rhythm of Bieber's vocals is pretty neat
	- The build-up to that thunderous chorus is also pretty good
	
3. "Love Yourself" - Justin Bieber

	- Simple pop song; just Bieber's vocals and a clean electric guitar
	- I like that chorus; the backing vocals behind the main line is top-notch
	- "You should go and LOVE yourself"; I'm pretty sure Bieber is meaning to use a harsher word here
	- A nice tastful trumpet solo in the middle; I like it
	- I like how the backing vocals change a bit on that last line; great composition


4. "Pillowtalk" - Zayn

	- This is the first #1 hit by a former member of "One Direction", a boy band from the UK that hit it big in the early '10s
	- A bit of an industrial-sounding R&B song; lots of harsh percussion sounds with low bass notes and synths
	- I'm sorry, I can barely understand what Zayn is saying here; I guess the song's about sex? I have no clue. I think maybe his singing style just doesn't fit here

5. "Work" - Rihanna feat. Drake

	- Okay, it took the caribbean-born Rihanna a while, but she finally a proper dancehall song this time!
	- The tropical beat is pretty neat; the way it continues to accend makes it feel like the kind of thing to bring your spirits up
	- The "work, work, work, work, work, work" patois by Rihanna during the chorus is pretty solid, but probably could of used some more lyrics
	- Drake's verse is decent, but I think the lyrics could've used some work
	
6. "Panda" - Desiigner

	- Our first "indie" trap rap song; Panda literally just took a free beat he took off of Youtube and rapped over it. That's all it took to hit #1 in 2016! I honestly think that's amazing.
	- Okay, maybe they could have edited out the "free-beats.com" intro in the offical single.
	- I'm a sucker for those "brrrrrrrraps" and "gat gat gats!" I can't help but get into a rap song with a hype man that hyped.
	- Panda's flow is pretty damn good, but I can't understand a word this guys saying. I mean, he's not English ASL; dude grew up in Brooklyn.
	- A little too repetitive, too much hype-man, could be shorter overall
	
7. "One Dance" - Drake feat. Wizkid & Kyla

	- Wow, another dancehall song; Uses more 808s and less steel drums
	- It's a got nice bit of sampling throughout, but Drake's performance is just really boring on this one

8. "Can't Stop the Feeling!" - Justin Timberlake

	- Upbeat funk-pop song; written for the film "Trolls"
	- Solid funk foundation on this one; good composition
	- Timberlake's vocals are on-point here
	- The chorus is great, but a little over-produced for my liking
	
9. "Cheap Thrills" - Sia feat. Sean Paul

	- Okay, I guess we're going all out with dancehall this year. We even got Sean Paul to help out too!
	- Damnit, we we're so close to having 2 straight years of well-produced tracks. This one sounds like garbage. The chorus is so muddled and there's like a baby crying in the background just to put the final nail in the coffin
	- I guess Sean Paul's verse is okay; he's doing what he's best at
	
10. "Closer" - The Chainsmokers feat. Halsey

	- Our first huge #1 hit song in quite a while; this one ran 12 consectutive weeks at #1
	- To my disappointment, it is NOT a cover of the Nine Inch Nails song; instead we got an electronic dance song
	- I like the piano foundation of the song; The synth stabs that make up the song are also pretty good
	- The lyrical cadence leading up to the chorus is good, but I can't say the same for the lyrics
	- Can't say I like the chorus bass drop; sounds like it was made on a Fisher-Price instrument
	- Halsey's voice is pretty solid on this one; definitely better than whatever The Chainsmokers are doing

11. "Black Beatles" - Rae Sremmurd feat. Gucci Mane
	
	- Trap rap song
	- It's got a decent beat; mezmerizing
	- I really can't say the Beatles comparisons are that great; I don't think these guys know much about them
	- Mane's verse is just funny as hell to listen to; it's like he has no care in the world
	- Well, I guess they've at least heard "Daytripper" at least once, since they borrow a lyric from that song

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Hello" - Adele
2. "Love Yourself" - Justin Bieber
3. "Sorry" - Justin Bieber
4. "Can't Stop the Feeling!" - Justin Timberlake
5. "Work" - Rihanna feat. Drake
6. "Panda" - Desiigner
7. "Closer" - The Chainsmokers feat. Halsey
8. "Black Beatles" - Rae Sremmurd feat. Gucci Mane
9. "Pillowtalk" - Zayn
10. "One Dance" - Drake feat. Wizkid & Kyla
11. "Cheap Thrills" - Sia feat. Sean Paul

Well, I guess after 2015, the best year in #1 hits, we had only one direction to go (down, of course). However, it didn't need to go down into "meh"; too many half-assed dancehall songs, and some poor production jobs really brought this year down. Well, I guess I really can't complain all that much since we are in the home stretch, so let's finish this.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2017
----

1. "Starboy" - The Weeknd feat. Daft Punk

	- Of course the beat is amazing; it's made by Daft Punk!
	- Solid vocal performance by The Weeknd; great vocal cadence and control
	- That chorus is so Daft Punk; those vocoder vocals are iconic as hell

2. "Black Beatles" - Rae Sremmurd feat. Gucci Mane
	
	- Trap rap song
	- It's got a decent beat; mezmerizing
	- I really can't say the Beatles comparisons are that great; I don't think these guys know much about them
	- Mane's verse is just funny as hell to listen to; it's like he has no care in the world
	- Well, I guess they've at least heard "Daytripper" at least once, since they borrow a lyric from that song

3. "Bad and Boujee" - Migos feat. Lil' Uzi Vert

	- Trap rap song
	- Solid triplet flows from Offset and the Scottish Snaps by Quavo are pretty good too
	- Great hype man; "woo woo!" "brraaaappp!" "skrrrrtt!"
	- Uzi Vert's verse is a little too silly; seems a bit out of place
	- It's basically a much better version of "Panda" by Desiigner
	
4. "Shape Of You" - Ed Sheeran

	- Pop song; has a dancehall feel to it
	- The main beat is pretty solid; I like the muted guitar scratches
	- Great vocal performance by Sheeran; not half-bad lyrics either
	- Just a very well-composed pop song all around
	
5. "Humble" - Kendrick Lamar

	- That beat is so damn good; the bass piano notes that drive it were a great idea
	- The vocal acrobatics by Lamar are just insane; he's bouncing all over the place here; quite impressive
	- This is probably the most profane song to hit #1; I think the word "bitch" is said more than any other word in the chorus... I love it!

6. "That's What I Like" - Bruno Mars

	- Another throwback song; this time I think Mars is going for a '90s R&B sound here
	- Fantastic vocal performance by Mars; great cadence and control throughout
	- That chorus is really good; very catchy
	- Honestly, he's done it again; Another case of making the "perfect" song from an older era of music

7. "I'm The One" - DJ Khaled feat. Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper & Lil' Wayne

	- This is probably the most features I've seen so far for a #1 hit song... OH GOD Lil' Wayne is back
	- "Anotha one!" I friggin love Khaled; I don't think he realizes how much of a meme he's become
	- Despite all of these collaborators, they couldn't throw together a verse that doesn't make them look like complete clowns
	- This upbeat, cheery beat just feels really out of place with these lyrics
	- I will say this is probably Lil' Wayne's best performance so far... which is saying it's just "bad" and not "terrible"

8. "Despacito (Remix)" - Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee feat. Justin Bieber

	- Latin Pop song; sung in Spanish mostly
	- Okay WOW. This one manage to tie Boyz II Men & Mariah Carey's "One Sweet Day" for long-running #1 single; going 16 weeks straight! Does it stack up?
	- Meh, can't say it does. It's catchy, but it really lacks the "oompf" other juggernauts
	- Both Bieber and Fonsi's verses are just so plain and boring; Daddy Yankee's verse has more of an edge to it, but that's about it
	- I put it on the shelf with Ricky Martin's "Livin' la Vida Loca" for being too boring for a Latin song
	
9. "Look What You Made Me Do" - Taylor Swift

	- Electro-pop dance song
	- Okay, that chorus is just terrible; it's ashame since everything else is okay
	- It's like a lamer version "I'm Too Sexy" by Right Said Fred
	
10. "Bodak Yellow" - Cardi B

	- Our first female rapper to score a trap rap #1 hit
	- Her flow is pretty solid but her voice is just annoying here, can't say much else
	
11. "Rockstar" - Post Malone feat. 21 Savage

	- Another trap rap song; this one's in the sub-sub-genre of "cloud" rap
	- Malone's verses are a bit too plain, but the middle part where he sings a bit is quite nice
	- 21 Savage's verse is probably the best part of the song

12. "Perfect" - Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé

	- Acoustic pop love song
	- Sheeran's voice is good; not crazy amazing, but still good
	- The chorus is pretty solid; not half-bad
	- Beyoncé is the best part of the song; she really cares that second and final verse

OVERALL RANKING

1. "That's What I Like" - Bruno Mars
2. "Humble" - Kendrick Lamar
3. "Starboy" - The Weeknd feat. Daft Punk
4. "Perfect" - Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé
5. "Bad and Boujee" - Migos feat. Lil' Uzi Vert
6. "Shape Of You" - Ed Sheeran
7. "Rockstar" - Post Malone feat. 21 Savage
8. "Black Beatles" - Rae Sremmurd feat. Gucci Mane

10. "Bodak Yellow" - Cardi B
11. "I'm The One" - DJ Khaled feat. Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper & Lil' Wayne
12. "Look What You Made Me Do" - Taylor Swift

Another "meh" year; this time we got some real lame songs this year, but we also got some really good ones this year too so I guess it just kinda balances out. At this point, I guess artists for this decade started to coast on their success with some easy lay-up songs.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2018
----

1. "Perfect" - Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé

	- Acoustic pop love song
	- Sheeran's voice is good; not crazy amazing, but still good
	- The chorus is pretty solid; not half-bad
	- Beyoncé is the best part of the song; she really cares that second and final verse
	
2. "Havana" - Camila Cabello feat. Young Thug

	- Salsa-inspired pop song
	- The salsa piano-riff that drives the song is very catchy
	- Solid vocal performance by Cabello; great voice
	- Young Thug's verse is hiliarious; it's like he doesn't want to wake up his parents next door, and he's also drunk as hell
	- Nice tasteful trumpet solo towards the end
	
3. "God's Plan" - Drake

	- I really like those ethereal synths that drive the song; reminds me of the soundtrack to "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver"
	- Solid flows by Drake, but he sounds so bored on this one
	- I can't help but laugh at the "Turn the O2 into the O3!" line
	
4. "Nice For What" - Drake

	- Has a bit of a throwback feel to early '90s rap from New Orleans called "Bounce"
	- That beat is great; makes me want to get up and kick ass
	- Drake really picked up the pace on this one, he's a lot more excited and his flows are on-point
	- I really love that breakdown towards the end; top-notch production quality
	
5. "This Is America" - Childish Gambino

	- Artsy fartsy trap rap song with some afrobeat intermissions throughout; touches on the topics of police, gun violence, and racism
	- Great intro; very catchy and has some amazing melodic timbre
	- The way the afrobeat sections hard cut into that sinister oscillating bass line is terrifying; it's like the song's saying "you happy right now? You enjoying life right now? We'll now I'm pointing a gun at your head... give me your money or die."
	- Gambino's flows and lyrics are a bit ambiguous and esoteric, but that was probably the whole point
	- The minimalistic beat with the shrill synths in the outro is great composition
	
6. "Psycho" - Post Malone feat. Ty Dolla Sign

	- Cloud rap song
	- Solid beat; very dreamy and pleasant
	- Malone's flows are decent; a bit forced in the chorus but he sounds good everywhere else
	- Ty Dolla Sign's verse is pretty good; solid performance

7. "Sad!" - XXXTentacion

	- Damn, just four years ago we had a #1 hit song called "Happy", now we're "Sad!". Times must have gotten tough in four years!
	- Another cloud rap song; This is our most recent posthumous #1 hit, going #1 two weeks after XXXTentacion was murdered at a car dealership
	- I like the beat; very floaty and hazy
	- Great chorus; catchy and... sad I guess?
	
8. "I Like It" - Cardi B, Bad Bunny & J Balvin

	- A Latin trap rap song? I guess it was inevitable
	- Cardi B's performance is almost as identical to hers on "Kodak Black": solid flows; annoying voice
	- Bad Bunny's voice is way to monotone on his verse
	- J Balvin's verse is a bit better, still just "okay" overall
	- A bit better than "Kodak Black", but not by much

9. "In My Feelings" - Drake

	- Another "Bounce" rap song; this one's a bit less energetic
	- This really just sounds like a Bounce version of "God's Plan"
	- The breakdown isn't as nearly exciting as on "Nice For What" an- OH MY GOD they sampled Lil' Wayne's "Lolipop"! My God...

10. "Girls Like You" - Maroon 5 feat. Cardi B

	- Wow, our first pop song to hit #1 this year... and it's a "4-chords" song!
	- The acoustic guitar intro is kinda neat
	- Meh, the whole song is just boring; it drags on and the chorus is no where near as catchy as Adam Levine think's it is
	- Cardi B's verse is realllllyyyy out of place here
	
11. "Thank U, Next" - Ariana Grande

	- It's basically a pop version of "To All The Girls I've Loved Before" by Julio Iglesias & Willie Nelson, except it's from the girls perspective
	- I like the dreamy keys that drive the song; they almost have a "Christmas" feel to it
	- Solid vocal performance by Grande on this one; suits the song very well
	- I never thought I'd ever hear a happy break-up song, let alone one that went to #1
	
12. "Sicko Mode" - Travis Scott

	- This one's pretty unique; it's like a "prog" rap song; I know I'm gonna love this one!
	- The intro is great; those soaring horn synths really give the song a huge sound
	- Wow okay, Drake's on this one; I guess he's uncredited. He's does a good job with the intro though
	- Okay, here's the prog part; the whole song changes key to this tight beat with a filthy bassline. I like it!
	- Scott's flows are really good too; this song's impressing me every turn so far
	- Another key change; this time the breakdown flows into another tight beat with some twinkly keys
	- Drake comes back on the last verse; he also does a pretty bang up job on this one too

OVERALL RANKING

1. "This Is America" - Childish Gambino
2. "Sicko Mode" - Travis Scott
3. "Nice For What" - Drake
4. "Sad!" - XXXTentacion
5. "Thank U, Next" - Ariana Grande
6. "Havana" - Camila Cabello feat. Young Thug
7. "Perfect" - Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé
8. "Psycho" - Post Malone feat. Ty Dolla Sign
9. "In My Feelings" - Drake
10. "God's Plan" - Drake
11. "I Like It" - Cardi B, Bad Bunny & J Balvin
12. "Girls Like You" - Maroon 5 feat. Cardi B

This was a year dominated by hip hop, both good and bad songs. I'm liking this era of "Trap" Rap, it's got this minimalistic feel to it and some solid vocal rhythms. Even if I didn't like it, I'd still much prefer this to the "Crunk" era of 2005/06. That was hard to get through.

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2019
----

1. "Thank U, Next" - Ariana Grande

	- It's basically a pop version of "To All The Girls I've Loved Before" by Julio Iglesias & Willie Nelson, except it's from the girls perspective
	- I like the dreamy keys that drive the song; they almost have a "Christmas" feel to it
	- Solid vocal performance by Grande on this one; suits the song very well
	- I never thought I'd ever hear a happy break-up song, let alone one that went to #1

2. "Without Me" - Halsey

	- I like the reverb-effect on the guitar that drives the beat; it sounds like it's being played at the bottom of the ocean
	- Solid chorus; Halsey's voice is pretty good here
	- Good song; solid production and mixing on this one
	
3. "Sunflower" - Post Malone & Swae Lee

	- Dreamy hip hop song; written for the film "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"
	- I like that staggered rhythm that drives the song; it's got spunk!
	- The bass synths are fantastic; really gives the song a big sound
	- Both Swae Lee and Post Malone have really good voices on this one; sometimes rappers can sound angelic!
	
4. "7 Rings" - Ariana Grande

	- Looks like trap rap has found it's way into the standard pop number
	- The scotch snaps during the chorus remind me of Destiny's Child a bit; not half-bad
	- Okay, the rap verse by Grande towards the end is hiliarious; she's got a good flow, but she sounds like a chipmunk

5. "Shallow" - Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper

	- Acoustic ballad; main single off of the soundtrack of the 2018 "A Star Is Born" remake
	- Solid chord progression on the acoustic guitar; reminds me of "Stay (I Missed You)" by Lisa Loeb a bit
	- Cooper's voice isn't half-bad for someone whos main profession is acting
	- Of course Gaga's voice steals the show; especially during that chorus
	
6. "Sucker" - Jonas Brothers

	- Pop rock song; first #1 hit for the boy band, and it's a decade after their peak popularity in the late '00s
	- It's hard to tell all of their voices apart, but they all sound good for the most part.
	- It's catchy and funky, but it sounds almost exactly like "Feel It Still" by Portugal. The Man

7. "Old Town Road" - Lil' Nas X feat. Billy Ray Cyrus

	- We did it folks. We've finally surpassed "One Sweet Day" by Boyz II Men & Mariah Carey as the longest running #1 hit. This time, this one ran 19 weeks consectutively... and it's a self-produce trap rap song about riding horses. Ha!
	- Solid beat; uses a Nine Inch Nails sample which is probably why I like it
	- Billy Ray Cyrus' voice somehow managed to hold up after all of these years
	- Lil' Nas X's verses are so funny to listen to; he clearly doesn't give AF
	- I never thought I'd hear Billy Ray Cyrus rap... and it's actually not half-bad either

8. "Bad Guy" - Billie Eilish

	- That's one hell of a sinister bassline; just glad to hear a proper electric bass
	- The staggered whispered vocals are an interesting creative choice; it's like a drunk ghost singing the song
	- The electric keys that play after the chorus are so silly; it's like something out of Austin Powers
	- I like the breakdown towards the end; makes the song a little less silly for sure

9. "Señorita" - Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello

	- Latin pop song
	- Cabello's vocals on the chorus are just a little too shrill for my tasteful
	- Mendes' voice isn't half-bad; I do think he's the better half of this song
	- Honestly, hey actually have a pretty good vocal chemistry
	- It's not a bad song, but it's nothing too special
	
10. "Truth Hurts" - Lizzo

	- Trap rap song; originally released in 2017, but became a sleeper hit this year
	- The ragtime piano that drives the melody is neat
	- Solid beat and Lizzo's flows are on-point
	- She sounds like a better version of Cardi-B, honestly
	- Funny lyrics, and she pulls them off well
	
11. "Highest in the Room" - Travis Scott

	- Scotts' performance just feels lazy on this one; he sounds as boring as the beat for this song
	
12. "Someone You Loved" - Lewis Capaldi

	- Piano ballad; nice hearing one of these amongst all of the trap
	- Capaldi's got a great vocal range, and his performance during that chorus and bridge is fantastic
	- Overall, just a well-composed and made pop song

13. "Lose You to Love Me" - Selena Gomez

	- Two piano ballads in a row!
	- I like the chord progression; very somber and a little bit sinister
	- Gomez's voice is great; I really like when the chorus brings in those backing vocals
	- I do kind of wish there was more to the song; seems incomplete
	
14. "Circles" - Post Malone

	- Great reverberated acoustic-guitar; and that bassline is great!
	- The whole song has this hazy dream feel to it; I like it
	- Malone's vocal performance is great here; I love the reverb and tremolo he puts on the chorus
	- Honestly, I think Post Malone should just stick to doing harmonic singing; it suits him very well

15. "Heartless" - The Weeknd

	- Trap rap song; it's got this '80s synthwave feel to it
	- Solid beat and The Weeknd is really going hard on this one
	- The chorus is very catchy and I love the reverb on his voice
	- The breakdown on the bridge is fantastic; it's like a bubble-bath in music form
	
16. "All I Want for Christmas Is You" - Mariah Carey

	- Whoa, this is NOT a contemporary song... this one was released back in 1994! I guess it's a testament to how much this song has eclipsed any and all other Christmas in popularity
	- ...and rightfully so; this is probably the "perfect" Christmas song. It's got the best chord-progression, the best instrumentation, the best vocal performance, and the best song topic of any Christmas pop song I've ever heard

OVERALL RANKING

1. "Circles" - Post Malone
2. "Heartless" - The Weeknd
3. "Old Town Road" - Lil' Nas X feat. Billy Ray Cyrus
4. "Sunflower" - Post Malone & Swae Lee

13. "Sucker" - Jonas Brothers
14. "7 Rings" - Ariana Grande
15. "Señorita" - Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello
16. "Highest in the Room" - Travis Scott

Good year; can't say it was out-of-this-world, but for the most part, I liked all of them. The novelty of trap rap is wearing a bit thin, but the production quality is still top-notch, and the talent is still there. We are almost done folks! Just one more year left! 2020 let's go!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2020
----

1. "All I Want for Christmas Is You" - Mariah Carey

	- Whoa, this is NOT a contemporary song... this one was released back in 1994! I guess it's a testament to how much this song has eclipsed any and all other Christmas songs in popularity
	- ...and rightfully so; this is probably the "perfect" Christmas song. It's got the best chord-progression, the best instrumentation, the best vocal performance, and the best song topic of any Christmas pop song I've ever heard

2. "Circles" - Post Malone

	- Great reverberated acoustic-guitar; and that bassline is great!
	- The whole song has this hazy dream feel to it; I like it
	- Malone's vocal performance is great here; I love the reverb and tremolo he puts on the chorus
	- Honestly, I think Post Malone should just stick to doing harmonic singing; it suits him very well
	
3. "The Box" - Roddy Ricch

	- Trap rap song; another self-produced artist
	- The wind-shield wiper "eee err" vocal hook is pretty silly, but it doesn't feel too out of place honestly
	- Ricch has got some solid flows and the lyrics are also pretty solid too
	- The faint piano chords that lie under the beat are just the icing on the cake

4. "Blinding Lights" - The Weeknd

	- Synthwave song
	- Wow, great production on this one; reminds me of a Hall & Oates song
	- Very catchy synths lines; great meleody!
	- Outstanding vocal performance by The Weeknd; especially on that chorus
	
5. "Toosie Slide" - Drake

	- Trap rap song that's also a dance song; also about social media influencer and Atlanta choreographer Toosie
	- Honestly, this one's just boring to listen to; nothing really exciting about this one

6. "The Scotts" - The Scotts

	- Rap duo consisting of Travis Scott & Kid Cudi 
	- I kinda like the beat; it's got this "ballroom music playing on an old record player" feel to it
	- Travis Scott's verses really aren't all that great and Kid Cudi sounds really goofy on this one
	- The synth breakdown towards the end sounds like the music from an old MS-DOS RPG game; I like it

7. "Say So" - Doja Cat feat. Nicki Minaj

	- Disco-inspired pop song
	- The main riff sounds suspiciously like "Good Times" by Chic
	- Doja Cat's voice sounds pretty good; the airy vocals suit the song very well
	- Minaj's verse is a little ot of place here; kinda kills the vibe of the song

8. "Stuck with U" - Ariana Grande & Justin Bieber

	- Slow waltz; NOT a cover of the #1 hit by Huey Lewis & The News. Written as a sort of coronavirus pandemic love anthem
	- Both Grande and Bieber have great voices on this one; great vocal chemistry
	- Just a solid love duet; I'm surprised they could throw this together so quickly

9. "Savage" - Megan Thee Stallion feat. Beyoncé

	- I really like that melodic beat; I love some dissonance in my melody!
	- Great lyrics; really live up to the title of the song. She's savage
	- Beyoncé's rapping isn't actually half-bad; she's also got a pretty good lower vocal register

10. "Rain On Me" - Lady Gaga & Ariana Grande

	- Electro-pop song
	- This sounds so much like a Daft Punk song; I like it!
	- Gaga and Grande have such good voices on this one
	- I like the "Rain... On... Me!" lyric that Gaga does; it's like a vocal drop into the dance beat

11. "Rockstar" - DaBaby feat. Roddy Ricch

	- NOT at all related to the Post Malone song
	- I like the classical guitar that drives the beat
	- Both DaBaby and Ricch have some impressive rapping skills; great flows and vocal cadence
	- It's a good song, but I kinda wish there was more to this song; feels incomplete

12. "Trollz" - 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj

	- 6ix9ine reminds me so much of Lil' Wayne on that chours; it's like a younger more annoying version of him
	- 6ix9ine's "hardcore" rap style feels really forced; another case of sounding tough... although considering 6ix9ine's former gang activity, he may actually be "tough", but he sure doesn't sounds like it
	- Minaj also manages to sound as obnoxious as 6ix9ine on this one

13. "Cardigan" - Taylor Swift

	- Wow, okay... I guess Swift is now a indie-folk artist now
	- It's a very pleasant song to listen to, both lyrically and melodically. Sometimes I forget that Swift is an actual artist and not just some pop star
	- It's a good song, but it's still a far cry from the likes of Fleet Foxes or Bon Iver

14. "Watermelon Sugar" - Harry Styles

	- Another former One Direction member turned #1 hit solo artist; this one's a bit of a funk rock song
	- The main hook is a bit repetitive; kinda wish Styles had more to say than just "watermelon sugar"
	- It's catchy and fun, but it's really lacking that "punch" that a song like this ought to have

15. "WAP" - Cardi B feat. Megan Thee Stallion

	- We've finally made it to probably the single most sexually viseral song to ever reach #1; It's literally about wet ass pussies (WAP)! We've come a long way since the Rolling Stones singing about "spending the night together", that's for sure
	- That accending chromatic bass riff is just great; very metal!
	- These lyrics are some of the most shameless I've ever heard; The way they describe every kink in such detail is like a big middle-finger to the pearl-clutchers and social conservatives of the world
	- Oh yeah, their flows are also on-point here; can't forget that they can be compotent rappers sometimes
	
16. "Dynamite" - BTS

	- K-pop boy band doing a disco-pop song in english to appeal to a broader audience? Hey, I'm not one to complain
	- Damn, these guys are pretty funky and their english is actually pretty good here; they got a pretty commanding presence on this track
	- Godd performance from all involved; a well-produced funky pop song

17. "Franchise" - Travis Scott feat. Young Thug and M.I.A.

	- I really like those ominous synths that drive the song; makes the song feel so much more badass
	- Great flows by Scott and Young Thug; they really go hard here
	- It's cool to see M.I.A. on a #1 hit song years after her relevance, but she sounds so flat and bored on this one

18. "Savage Love (Laxed-Siren Beat)" - Jawsh 685, Jason Derulo & BTS

	- Reggaeton song; practically a cover of the song by BTS; Derulo is basically nowhere to be found
	- Honestly, this song is really tacky; the production sounds like it was made on a cheap plastic keyboard and BTS's performance is a little silly-sounding here


19. "Mood" - 24kGoldn feat. Iann Dior

	- Electric-guitar driven rap song
	- Very catchy beat and great flows by 24kGoldn and Dior


20. "Positions" - Ariana Grande

	- I like the pizzicato strings that drive the beat, but I can't say I like the cricket-chirping in the background; very distracting
	- I like how many layers of vocals are on the track; they all harmonize with each other very well and add a timbre to the song that many others don't have
	- Very catchy chorus; I like it

21. "Life Goes On" - BTS

	- The first #1 hit song to be in Korean; I guess BTS managed to become big enough in the states that the language barrier wasn't enough to keep these guys froming hitting #1
	- I like the laid-back beat with that guitar; very dreamy sounding and somber
	- Solid vocal work here; the group's got a nice vocal breadth
	- I do think the Korean rapping sections sound a bit forced and silly

22. "Willow" - Taylor Swift

	- Another indie-folk song by Swift
	- I really like that acoustic-guitar riff; very rich in sound
	- Great chorus; very catchy and singable
	- Another pleasant indie-folk venture; I think this one's even better than the last one she did

22. "Trollz" - 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj

After listening to over 1,130 songs, We've finally reached the end! Huzzah! Did we end on a good note? I'd say "yeah". I really have no clue which direction pop music is heading, but I really can't complain as the stuff that's here really isn't half-bad. I really like seeing songs hit #1 from artists who only just a week or two before that, were just messing around with some free beats off of YouTube, and then uploading their finished product up on Soundcloud or where ever else. THAT is inspiring if you ask me. Anyway, since we are at the end now, I will be soon working on some extended posts that will rank all of my favorite #1 hits across all of the decades as well as some other one-off posts related to the project. I hope to see you there!

----------------------------------------------------------

----
2021 (BONUS YEAR)
----

Well, since I've gotten pretty lazy with updates to the project, I manage to delay all the way into the new year, which gives me an excuse to rank the #1 hits of 2021! Let's see what last year had in store for us!


1. "All I Want for Christmas Is You" - Mariah Carey

	- This song will probably be #1 every December and early January from here 'til eternity. I guess Mariah Carey will never not have a steady source of income; good for her

2. "Mood" - 24kGoldn feat. Iann Dior

	- Electric-guitar driven rap song
	- Very catchy beat and great flows by 24kGoldn and Dior

3. "Drivers License" - Olivia Rodrigo
	
	- Dreamy power ballad; breakup song centered around Olivia getting her driver licence and driving around alone
	- It's like Olivia is the teen version of Adele, she's even got a good voice for the most part
	- I like the breakdown in the second half, nice change up to the song
	
4. "What's Next" - Drake

	- Solid beat, I love that repeating two-note synth riff with that low bass rumble
	- Not half-bad flows by Drake; the lyrics are okay
	- Much better than most of his previous work, but it's no "Nice For What"
	
5. "Up" - Cardi B

	- Gritty "bad bitch" rap song
	- Oh wow, a Rolands drum machine in the beat; that's a nice throwback!
	- The chorus is little too repetitive; there are words that rhythm with "Up", Cardi. You don't gotta say it over and over again
	- This feels like a sequel to "WAP", both in style and sound, but doesn't hit nearly as hard

6. "Peaches" - Justin Bieber feat. Daniel Caesar & Giveon

	- Low tempo, funk-pop song
	- I guess Bieber is a rapper now, huh
	- The main hook is a little cheesy
	- Both Daniel Caesar and Giveon's voices are amazing; Nice and smooth. Honestly this should be their song solely. Bieber is really out of place here
	- I like the synthy outro; kinda feels like a Daft Punk song
	
	
7. "Montero (Call Me by Your Name)" - Lil' Nas X

	- Ah, yes... I remember this. The kid-friendly, cowboy rapper dude who did "Old Town Road" came out as gay, and the whole world lost their damn mind. Then he makes this gay amthem to troll everyone. Let's see if the song holds up on it's own
	- It's like a fusion of flamenco and trap; has a nice beat
	- Thematically biblical; elluding to original sin and the like
	- Meh, it's an okay song; music video is hilarious though
	
8. "Leave the Door Open" - Silk Sonic (Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak)

	- Bruno Mars has made an '80s and '90s throwback already, it makes sense that he'd make a '70s one. This one's a Philidelphia Soul song.
	- Both Mars' and .Paak's voice are perfect for this song; great performances
	- Insanely smooth and well-constructed; each verse, chorus, and the bridge blends together very well
	- It's a really good song, but I think this is the lesser throwback hit by Mars, compared to "Uptown Funk" and "That's What I Like"

9. "Rapstar" - Polo G

	- Cloud rap song; utilizes an arpeggiated ukulele riff as the base
	- It's not half-bad, but it's really indistinguishable from a lot of other cloud rap.
	
10. "Save Your Tears" - The Weeknd & Ariana Grande

	- The synthwave R&B singer is back with another #1 hit song
	- The main hook is a little dull, at least compared to The Weeknd's previous hits from this album
	- Grande's ad-libed backing vocals are pleasant and subtle; I like it
	- Grande's verses are solid, but nothing too special
	- Wow, two #1 hit songs this year with "Daft Punky" outros? Nice!
	
11. "Good 4 U" - Olivia Rodrigo

	- Wow, I really like that gritty bassline during the verses. Kinda reminds me of "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails for some reason
	- Meh, the chorus sounds like every pop punk song ever written; at least it's upbeat and catchy
	- The bridge is great; I love that build-up to the chorus
	- Actually, I just realized... this is basically what Avril Lavigne tried to do years ago but failed. This is like a better version of "Girlfriend" but by several magnitudes
	
12. "Butter" - BTS

	- The most popular K-pop boy band with another English-sung #1 hit
	- Solid groove; love that bassline
	- Man, I can't say I dislike the current trend of fusing synthwave into every song... it's a good genre!
	- The rap verses actually aren't half-bad; a little tacky considering the group, but executed well enough
	
13. "Permission to Dance" - BTS

	- Another English-sung #1 hit by BTS; Written by Ed Sheeran and others
	- Has a nice '70s funk fusion groove; I like it
	- Very catchy and upbeat, however it's a little to bubblegummy for my taste
	
14. "Stay" - The Kid Laroi & Justin Bieber

	- Upbeat cloud rap song
	- Wow, this main riff sounds like Star Fox on the Super Nintendo
	- The chorus is nice; it sounds like something The Weeknd would do
	- Bieber's verse and even his voice is really indistinguishable from The Kid Laroi's, kinda wish he took a different approach with this one
	- Short and sweet; if it wasn't for The Kid Laroi's voice, I really would have confused this song with The Weeknd
	
15. "Way 2 Sexy" - Drake feat. Future & Young Thug

	- Rap song; interpolates Right Said Fred's 1991 #1 hit "I'm Too Sexy"
	- Laughably comedic; they tried real hard to make the goofy, tongue-in-cheek original hit by Right Said Fred sound badass, but they failed
	- Future sounds like he's about to pass out; I guess that's his appeal, but I'm ust not feeling it
	- Young Thug somehow manages to have the better verse, despite sounding like a 12 year old kid
	
16. "My Universe" - Coldplay & BTS

	- Never thought I'd see Coldplay on the top of the charts again, but I suspect it's BTS and their fans that put this song up there
	- Has a bit of an electro funk feel to it
	- BTS is actually singing in Korean on this one, with Coldplay doing the English parts
	- Meh, the rap verse is a little out of place here for the style of song
	- 2021: The year everyone tried to write a Daft Punk outro...
	
17. "Industry Baby" - Lil' Nas X feat. Jack Harlow

	- Solid flows by both Lil' Nas X and Jack Harlow; I feel like at this point, Lil' Nas X is owning his meme personality and honestly, it works for him
	- Funny lyrics; much better than Montero, I think

18. "Easy On Me" - Adele

	- Adele is back after 6 years; is she still making great hits?
	- Yup. No surprise here. She's still got it
	- Another great piano ballad; I'd rank it somewhere between "Someone Like You" and "Rolling In The Deep"

19. "All Too Well (Taylor's Version) - Taylor Swift

	- A Re-recording of an old song from 2012 of hers due to some legal disputes; let's see if after all these years, she can make her old hits better
	- It took nearly 50 years, but we finally got a #1 hit that's longer than "American Pie"; this one clocks in at 10 minutes 13 seconds!
	- Okay, the "Fuck the patriarchy" line is just too hiliarious for a song like this one
	- She's got an amazing voice on this one; Great range and control, and very reminiscent of her old country singer days
	- The way the song builds up and breaks down is just great; I'd never thought I'd here a pop song keep my attention for this long

OVERALL RANKING

1. "All Too Well (Taylor's Version) - Taylor Swift
2. "Easy On Me" - Adele
3. "Drivers License" - Olivia Rodrigo
4. "Leave the Door Open" - Silk Sonic (Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak)
5. "Good 4 U" - Olivia Rodrigo
6. "Stay" - The Kid Laroi & Justin Bieber
7. "Industry Baby" - Lil' Nas X feat. Jack Harlow
8. "Peaches" - Justin Bieber feat. Daniel Caesar & Giveon
9. "Mood" - 24kGoldn feat. Iann Dior

12. "Butter" - BTS
13. "Up" - Cardi B
14. "Permission to Dance" - BTS
15. "Montero (Call Me by Your Name)" - Lil' Nas X
16. "What's Next" - Drake
17. "Rapstar" - Polo G
18. "Way 2 Sexy" - Drake feat. Future & Young Thug

Man, I kinda wish I didn't make the cut-off for my megalist at 2020. There were some great #1 hits this year! There were some duds though; I guess that's par for the course. This will almost certainly be my last year I rank #1 hits, so I guess I'll just leave you al with this: There really isn't any years in the past where we had "good" music. Maybe what reaches #1 in a given year isn't all that great, but that doesn't mean that the music from that year as a whole was bad. I mean, we just finished up with 2021, and even I think this was a good year and I mostly listen to rock from the 20th century. So for any of you who have been following this project who don't really keep up with today's music, I implore you to check out some of the stuff I've been posting about. You might find some great new stuff that you've been missing out on!
